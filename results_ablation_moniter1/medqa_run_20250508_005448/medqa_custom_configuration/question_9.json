  "question": "A 35-year-old African American woman comes to the physician because of intermittent palpitations over the past 2 weeks. During this period she has also had constipation and has felt more tired than usual. She was diagnosed with hypertension 4 weeks ago and treatment with chlorthalidone was begun. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 158/97 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen. There is mild weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.5 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 146 mEq/L\nCl\u2212 100 mEq/L\nK+ 2.8 mEq/L\nHCO3\u2212 30 mEq/L\nGlucose 97 mg/dL\nUrea nitrogen 10 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nTest of the stool for occult blood is negative. An ECG shows premature atrial complexes. Chlorthalidone is discontinued and oral potassium chloride therapy is begun. One week later, the patient's plasma aldosterone concentration is 26 ng/dL (N=3.6 to 24.0 ng/dL) and plasma renin activity is 0.8 ng/mL/h (N=0.3 to 4.2 ng/mL/h). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"",
