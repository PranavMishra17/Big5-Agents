These findings are consistent with **infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)**, a condition characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle leading to gastric outlet obstruction. IHPS typically manifests in the first few weeks of life and is more common in male infants. Risk factors include formula feeding, exposure to macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), and genetic predisposition.\n\nThe question asks which intervention would have been most likely to reduce the risk of the infant developing this condition.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **A. Feeding of soy milk formula**\n- **Strengths:** Soy milk formula might theoretically reduce the risk of allergic, inflammatory, or other gastrointestinal reactions compared to cow's milk-based formulas. However, there is no evidence that soy milk formula specifically reduces the risk of pyloric stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** Formula feeding (regardless of type) is associated with an increased risk of developing IHPS compared to breastfeeding. This option does not address the underlying pathophysiology or risk factors for IHPS.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is unlikely to be correct because formula feeding (including soy milk) is a known risk factor for IHPS.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Breastfeeding only**\n- **Strengths:** Breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of IHPS compared to formula feeding. Breast milk is easier to digest, and the act of breastfeeding may reduce gastric stress and inflammation. Epidemiological studies have shown that exclusively breastfed infants have a lower incidence of IHPS.\n- **Weaknesses:** While breastfeeding reduces the risk, it does not completely eliminate it, as IHPS can still occur in breastfed infants due to other factors (e.g., genetic predisposition or exposure to macrolide antibiotics).\n- **Conclusion:** This is a strong candidate for the correct answer because exclusive breastfeeding is a well-documented protective factor against IHPS.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Avoiding penicillin administration to the mother**\n- **Strengths:** Avoiding unnecessary antibiotic exposure during pregnancy or delivery can reduce certain risks to the infant. However, penicillin is not associated with IHPS. Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin) given to infants or mothers during the perinatal period are the antibiotics implicated in increasing the risk of IHPS.\n- **Weaknesses:** Penicillin administration to the mother is unlikely to have contributed to the development of IHPS in this infant. Moreover, withholding penicillin in cases of group B streptococci (GBS) colonization would pose significant risks to the infant, such as neonatal sepsis.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect because penicillin is not a known risk factor for IHPS, and avoiding it would not have reduced the risk of this condition.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Treating the infant with glucocorticoids**\n- **Strengths:** Glucocorticoids can reduce inflammation in certain conditions. However, IHPS is not an inflammatory condition; it is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, which is unrelated to immune-mediated inflammation.\n- **Weaknesses:** Glucocorticoids are not indicated for IHPS and would not prevent its development. This option also does not align with the pathophysiology of the disease.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect because glucocorticoids have no role in the prevention of IHPS.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **B. Breastfeeding only**\n\n#### Rationale:\nExclusive breastfeeding is a well-established protective factor against the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). Formula feeding has been shown to increase the risk of IHPS, likely due to differences in digestion and gastric emptying compared to breast milk. While other risk factors (e.g., genetic predisposition or macrolide exposure) cannot be entirely mitigated, breastfeeding is one of the most effective modifiable interventions to reduce the incidence of IHPS.\n\nPenicillin exposure to the mother is not implicated in IHPS, and avoiding it would pose unnecessary risks. Soy milk formula and glucocorticoids do not address the underlying risk factors for IHPS, making them less relevant options.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer: **B**"}

On physical examination, the infant has sunken fontanelles (suggesting dehydration), tachycardia (pulse: 180/min), and a soft abdomen with a palpable, nontender epigastric mass. These findings are highly suggestive of **infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)**, a condition that leads to projectile vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances due to gastric outlet obstruction. The palpable epigastric mass (\"olive\") is a classic finding in IHPS.\n\n### Risk Factors for IHPS:\n\n1. **Male sex** (more common in males).\n2. **Firstborn status**.\n3. **Use of macrolide antibiotics** (e.g., erythromycin or azithromycin) in neonates or during pregnancy/lactation.\n4. **Bottle feeding** (as opposed to breastfeeding).\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **A. Feeding of soy milk formula**\n- **Strengths**: Soy milk formula is not specifically associated with an increased or decreased risk of IHPS. It is generally used for infants with cow's milk protein allergy or lactose intolerance.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no evidence to suggest that feeding soy milk formula would reduce the risk of IHPS. Formula feeding (of any type) is, in fact, a risk factor for IHPS compared to exclusive breastfeeding.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because it does not address the underlying risk factors for IHPS.\n\n#### **B. Breastfeeding only**\n- **Strengths**: Exclusive breastfeeding has been shown to be protective against IHPS compared to formula feeding. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it may relate to differences in feeding patterns or hormonal influences from breast milk.\n- **Weaknesses**: While breastfeeding reduces the risk of IHPS, it is not an absolute preventive measure, as IHPS can still occur in exclusively breastfed infants.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is correct because breastfeeding is a known protective factor for IHPS.\n\n#### **C. Avoiding penicillin administration to the mother**\n- **Strengths**: Penicillin is not a known risk factor for IHPS. Avoiding penicillin would not be expected to influence the incidence of IHPS.\n- **Weaknesses**: Group B streptococcal (GBS) prophylaxis with penicillin during labor is essential to prevent neonatal GBS infection, which can cause severe morbidity and mortality. Avoiding penicillin would put the infant at unnecessary risk of GBS infection.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because penicillin use in the mother is not related to IHPS and is critical for preventing neonatal GBS infection.\n\n#### **D. Treating the infant with glucocorticoids**\n- **Strengths**: Glucocorticoids are not relevant to the prevention or treatment of IHPS. Their use is typically reserved for conditions such as adrenal insufficiency or severe inflammation.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no evidence to support the use of glucocorticoids in preventing IHPS. Additionally, unnecessary glucocorticoid administration can have significant adverse effects, including immunosuppression and growth suppression.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because glucocorticoids have no role in preventing IHPS.\n\n### Correct Answer: **B. Breastfeeding only**\n\n### Rationale:\n\nBreastfeeding is a protective factor against IHPS, whereas formula feeding is associated with an increased risk. The protective effect of breastfeeding may be due to differences in feeding patterns, hormonal influences, or the composition of breast milk. In this case, the infant's feeding difficulties and vomiting are consistent with IHPS, and breastfeeding could have reduced the likelihood of developing this condition. While IHPS can still occur in breastfed infants, exclusive breastfeeding is the intervention most likely to decrease the risk of IHPS.\n\n### Final Answer: **B**"}
