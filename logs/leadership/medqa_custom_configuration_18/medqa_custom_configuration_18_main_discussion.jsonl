This option can be excluded.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low pH (<7.35) and decreased HCO3- (<22 mEq/L).\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient's pH is elevated (alkalosis), not decreased, and HCO3- is only slightly reduced (21 mEq/L), which does not support a primary metabolic acidosis. This option can be excluded.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory acidosis occurs when PaCO2 is elevated (>45 mm Hg), leading to a low pH (<7.35).\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient's PaCO2 is decreased (28 mm Hg), not elevated, and the pH is elevated (alkalosis), which is inconsistent with respiratory acidosis. This option can be excluded.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by an elevated pH (>7.45) and decreased PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg), which matches the patient's ABG findings (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg). This condition is often caused by hyperventilation, which may occur in response to hypoxemia or systemic stress, such as sepsis or pneumonia.\n- **Weaknesses**: The slightly reduced HCO3- (21 mEq/L) might suggest some degree of metabolic compensation, but this does not change the primary disturbance being respiratory alkalosis.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Principles:\n\n1. **Primary disturbance identification**: The elevated pH (alkalosis) and decreased PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) strongly suggest a primary respiratory alkalosis. \n2. **Compensation**: The slightly reduced HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is consistent with renal compensation for chronic respiratory alkalosis, but the primary disturbance remains respiratory.\n3. **Clinical context**: The patient's symptoms (fever, productive cough, hypoxemia, and tachypnea) are consistent with pneumonia, which can lead to hypoxemia-induced hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe acid-base disturbance that best characterizes this patient's condition is **Respiratory alkalosis**.\n\n**Correct Answer: D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n**Rationale**: The patient's elevated pH (7.52) and decreased PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) are diagnostic of respiratory alkalosis, which is consistent with hyperventilation due to hypoxemia from pneumonia. The slightly reduced HCO3- (21 mEq/L) reflects a mild compensatory response."}

The low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) points to hyperventilation as the primary cause, which is consistent with **respiratory alkalosis**. The mild reduction in HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is a compensatory response to the respiratory disturbance. This acid-base disturbance is often seen in patients with hypoxemia, as hyperventilation is a reflexive response to low oxygen levels, which is supported by the patient\u2019s PaO2 of 74 mm Hg.
