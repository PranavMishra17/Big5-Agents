Although she does not recall being bitten by an insect, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks, and many patients do not remember the bite.\n\nIf untreated, Lyme disease can progress through multiple stages, including early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated stages, causing systemic complications.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### A. **Necrotizing fasciitis**\n- **Strengths**: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe bacterial infection that rapidly destroys soft tissue. It can result from various pathogens, including *Streptococcus pyogenes* or mixed anaerobic organisms, and is associated with fever and systemic symptoms.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no indication of rapidly progressive tissue destruction or signs of necrotizing fasciitis in this patient. The bull\u2019s-eye rash is characteristic of Lyme disease, not necrotizing fasciitis. This option does not fit the clinical presentation or the natural course of untreated Lyme disease.\n\n#### B. **Bell\u2019s palsy**\n- **Strengths**: Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve paralysis) is a well-documented complication of untreated Lyme disease, particularly in the early disseminated stage. Lyme disease can cause neurological symptoms, including cranial nerve involvement, due to the spread of *Borrelia burgdorferi* into the central nervous system.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in the context of this clinical scenario. Bell\u2019s palsy is a recognized outcome of untreated Lyme disease and aligns with the patient\u2019s history and presentation.\n\n#### C. **Pseudomembranous colitis**\n- **Strengths**: Pseudomembranous colitis, caused by *Clostridioides difficile*, is associated with antibiotic use and diarrhea. It is a serious gastrointestinal condition.\n- **Weaknesses**: This condition is unrelated to Lyme disease or the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. There is no history of antibiotic use or gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis. This option is not relevant to the scenario.\n\n#### D. **Mitral valve prolapse**\n- **Strengths**: Mitral valve prolapse is a structural abnormality of the heart valve that can occur in the general population. It is sometimes associated with connective tissue disorders.\n- **Weaknesses**: Lyme disease can cause carditis (Lyme carditis), which may lead to arrhythmias or heart block, but it does not cause mitral valve prolapse. This option does not fit the clinical picture or the complications of untreated Lyme disease.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n- Lyme disease progresses through distinct stages if untreated. Early disseminated Lyme disease can cause neurological complications such as **cranial nerve palsies (e.g., Bell\u2019s palsy)**, meningitis, or radiculopathy. Late-stage Lyme disease can result in arthritis and chronic neurological symptoms.\n- The bull\u2019s-eye rash (erythema migrans) is pathognomonic for Lyme disease and strongly supports this diagnosis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **B. Bell\u2019s palsy**.\n\n#### Rationale:\nBell\u2019s palsy is a recognized complication of untreated Lyme disease during the early disseminated stage. The patient\u2019s clinical presentation, including the bull\u2019s-eye rash, systemic symptoms, and exposure in an endemic area, strongly suggests Lyme disease. If untreated, the infection can spread to the nervous system, causing cranial nerve involvement, including facial nerve paralysis (Bell\u2019s palsy). Other options do not align with the disease\u2019s pathophysiology or progression."}

If left untreated, Lyme disease can progress to disseminated or late-stage disease, resulting in complications involving the nervous system, joints, and heart.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n#### **A. Necrotizing fasciitis**\n- **Analysis**: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe bacterial infection that rapidly destroys soft tissue and fascia. It typically presents with rapidly spreading erythema, severe pain disproportionate to physical findings, systemic toxicity, and crepitus. This condition is unrelated to Lyme disease and lacks the hallmark bull\u2019s-eye rash.\n- **Strengths**: None in this context; the clinical presentation does not align with necrotizing fasciitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: The rash described (erythema migrans) is not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, nor are the systemic symptoms specific to this condition.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n#### **B. Bell\u2019s palsy**\n- **Analysis**: Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve palsy) is a common manifestation of **disseminated Lyme disease** due to *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Lyme disease can cause cranial neuropathy, particularly unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy. This is a well-documented complication of untreated Lyme disease.\n- **Strengths**: Bell\u2019s palsy is a recognized complication of Lyme disease, particularly in the disseminated stage. The patient is at risk for this condition if her Lyme disease remains untreated.\n- **Weaknesses**: None; this option aligns with the disease progression.\n- **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n#### **C. Pseudomembranous colitis**\n- **Analysis**: Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by *Clostridioides difficile* infection, often associated with antibiotic use or hospitalization. It presents with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and systemic symptoms like fever. There is no link between Lyme disease and pseudomembranous colitis.\n- **Strengths**: None in this context; pseudomembranous colitis is unrelated to Lyme disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: The clinical presentation does not involve gastrointestinal symptoms or antibiotic use, making this option irrelevant.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n#### **D. Mitral valve prolapse**\n- **Analysis**: Mitral valve prolapse is a structural heart condition, often congenital or acquired, but it is unrelated to Lyme disease. While Lyme carditis (heart block or myocarditis) can occur in disseminated Lyme disease, it does not cause mitral valve prolapse.\n- **Strengths**: None in this context; mitral valve prolapse is not linked to Lyme disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: Lyme disease does not cause valvular abnormalities like mitral valve prolapse.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**B. Bell\u2019s palsy**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with early Lyme disease, which, if untreated, can progress to disseminated Lyme disease. Complications of disseminated Lyme disease include **neurological manifestations**, such as **Bell\u2019s palsy** (cranial nerve VII palsy), meningitis, radiculopathy, and encephalopathy. Bell\u2019s palsy is a well-documented complication of Lyme disease and is the most relevant option based on the clinical scenario.\n\nOther options (necrotizing fasciitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and mitral valve prolapse) are unrelated to Lyme disease and do not fit the patient\u2019s presentation or disease progression.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B.

The history of a recent camping trip in Connecticut\u2014a region endemic to Lyme disease\u2014strongly suggests the diagnosis of **early Lyme disease** caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted by the bite of an infected *Ixodes* tick. The hallmark rash described, **erythema migrans**, is a key diagnostic clue for Lyme disease. \n\nUntreated Lyme disease can progress to later stages, causing a variety of systemic complications. Let\u2019s evaluate each answer choice systematically in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. Necrotizing fasciitis**\n- **Definition**: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe, rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the fascia, often caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* or other pathogens.\n- **Relevance**: The patient\u2019s symptoms and history do not suggest necrotizing fasciitis. There is no mention of rapidly spreading tissue necrosis, severe localized pain, or systemic toxicity that would indicate this condition.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is **unlikely** to be correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Bell\u2019s palsy**\n- **Definition**: Bell\u2019s palsy is a paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles, often due to inflammation or dysfunction of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). It is a known neurological complication of untreated Lyme disease, particularly in its early disseminated stage.\n- **Relevance**: If Lyme disease remains untreated, the infection can spread to the nervous system, causing cranial neuropathies such as Bell\u2019s palsy. This aligns with the patient\u2019s presentation of Lyme disease and its potential progression.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is a **strong contender**.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Pseudomembranous colitis**\n- **Definition**: Pseudomembranous colitis is an inflammatory condition of the colon, typically caused by *Clostridioides difficile* infection, often associated with antibiotic use.\n- **Relevance**: There is no indication of gastrointestinal symptoms or recent antibiotic use in this patient\u2019s history. Pseudomembranous colitis is unrelated to Lyme disease.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Mitral valve prolapse**\n- **Definition**: Mitral valve prolapse is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve, often congenital or idiopathic, and is typically unrelated to infectious processes.\n- **Relevance**: While Lyme disease can cause carditis (e.g., heart block or myocarditis), it does not lead to mitral valve prolapse. This option is unrelated to the patient\u2019s presentation.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **B. Bell\u2019s palsy**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s presentation (bull\u2019s-eye rash, fever, joint pain, neck stiffness) and history of a camping trip in an endemic area strongly suggest Lyme disease. If untreated, Lyme disease can progress to its early disseminated stage, which includes neurological complications such as **Bell\u2019s palsy**. This aligns with the systemic nature of untreated Lyme disease and its potential to cause cranial nerve dysfunction.\n\nOther options (A, C, D) are either unrelated to Lyme disease or not supported by the clinical presentation.

If untreated, Lyme disease can progress to more severe complications affecting various organ systems, including neurological, musculoskeletal, and cardiac systems.\n\nNow, systematic analysis of each option:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Necrotizing fasciitis**\n- **Strengths**: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe soft tissue infection that can cause systemic symptoms, such as fever and pain, and rapidly progress to life-threatening conditions. However, it does not typically present with a bull\u2019s-eye rash, nor is it associated with tick exposure or Lyme disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: The hallmark of necrotizing fasciitis is rapidly progressing tissue destruction, which is not described in this case. The rash in necrotizing fasciitis is usually erythematous or purpuric, not annular. This option is not relevant to the clinical presentation or history provided.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely to be correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Bell\u2019s palsy**\n- **Strengths**: Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve palsy) is a well-documented neurological complication of untreated Lyme disease. It typically occurs in the **disseminated stage** of Lyme disease, which can follow the early localized stage (characterized by the bull\u2019s-eye rash). Lyme disease can affect cranial nerves, leading to unilateral facial paralysis.\n- **Weaknesses**: While Bell\u2019s palsy is not present in this patient at the time of presentation, it is a potential complication if the disease remains untreated.\n- **Conclusion**: Plausible and relevant to the progression of untreated Lyme disease.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Pseudomembranous colitis**\n- **Strengths**: Pseudomembranous colitis is a severe gastrointestinal condition caused by *Clostridioides difficile* infection, often associated with antibiotic use.
