The clinical findings include a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple without skin or nipple changes or palpable axillary adenopathy. The goal is to determine the most appropriate next step in management.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. Bone scan**\n- **Strengths**: Bone scans are used to detect metastatic disease, particularly in cases of breast cancer that has spread to the bones.\n- **Weaknesses**: This is not appropriate as the next step in management for a newly identified breast mass. A diagnosis of malignancy has not yet been confirmed, and there is no clinical evidence of metastasis (e.g., bone pain or elevated serum markers). Bone scan is premature at this stage.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is inappropriate as the next step.\n\n#### **B. Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133**\n- **Strengths**: CA 15\u20133 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in breast cancer, particularly in metastatic disease. It is used for monitoring response to treatment or disease progression.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tumor markers like CA 15\u20133 are not used for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. They lack sensitivity and specificity for early-stage disease and are not helpful in determining the nature of a breast mass.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is not appropriate for initial diagnostic evaluation of a suspicious breast mass.\n\n#### **C. Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths**: Mastectomy is a definitive surgical treatment for certain types of breast cancer, especially large tumors or cases where breast conservation is not feasible.\n- **Weaknesses**: Mastectomy is premature at this stage because the diagnosis of malignancy has not yet been confirmed. Surgical treatment decisions depend on histopathological confirmation of cancer and staging, which requires a biopsy first.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is inappropriate as the next step.\n\n#### **D. Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths**: Core needle biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating suspicious breast masses. It allows for histological examination and determination of malignancy, tumor type, and receptor status (e.g., estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2).\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis before proceeding with further management.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the correct option.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n1. **Diagnostic Hierarchy**: When evaluating a suspicious breast mass, imaging findings (e.g., mammography) guide the next step, which is typically tissue sampling for histological diagnosis.\n2. **Avoid Premature Interventions**: Definitive treatment such as surgery or systemic evaluation for metastasis should only be pursued after a confirmed diagnosis of malignancy.\n3. **Evidence-Based Protocols**: Core needle biopsy is widely recommended as the first-line diagnostic procedure for breast masses due to its accuracy and minimally invasive nature.\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. Core needle biopsy**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe most appropriate next step is to perform a core needle biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis of the suspicious 2-cm breast mass. This is essential for determining whether the mass is malignant, benign, or represents another pathology. Once histopathological findings are available, further management (e.g., surgery, systemic therapy, or additional imaging) can be planned appropriately."}
