The hallmark of CCS is weakness that is more pronounced in the upper extremities than the lower extremities, along with sensory deficits (pain and temperature) in the upper extremities. Reflexes in the affected upper extremities may be diminished or absent due to damage to the central portion of the spinal cord, which primarily affects the corticospinal tract and spinothalamic tract.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral artery dissection or carotid artery injury, which can occur with trauma. It provides detailed imaging of blood vessels in the neck.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient's neurologic findings are more consistent with a spinal cord injury rather than a vascular injury. CT angiography would not provide information about spinal cord compression or intrinsic cord damage, which are the likely causes of his symptoms.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the best choice for confirming the cause of the neurologic findings.\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal and using imaging (usually CT) to visualize the spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding structures. It can identify spinal cord compression or abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is an invasive procedure and has largely been replaced by MRI, which provides superior visualization of soft tissue structures, including the spinal cord, without requiring contrast injection. MRI is safer and more informative for diagnosing spinal cord injuries.\n- **Conclusion**: While potentially useful, cervical myelography is not the optimal choice given the availability of MRI.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick, inexpensive, and useful for identifying fractures, dislocations, or gross bony abnormalities in the cervical spine.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays do not provide detailed information about the spinal cord or soft tissue structures, such as ligamentous injuries or cord edema. Given the patient's neurologic findings, the focus should be on assessing the spinal cord itself, which X-rays cannot adequately visualize.\n- **Conclusion**: X-rays are insufficient to confirm the cause of this patient's neurologic findings.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed imaging of the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, ligaments, and surrounding soft tissues. It can identify cord compression, edema, hemorrhage, or intrinsic cord damage, which are likely causes of this patient's symptoms.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context. MRI is non-invasive and highly effective for diagnosing central cord syndrome and other spinal cord injuries.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the optimal choice for confirming the cause of the patient's neurologic findings.\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient has neurologic findings consistent with central cord syndrome, which is most commonly caused by trauma leading to hyperextension injuries in older adults with preexisting cervical spondylosis. MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing spinal cord injuries, as it provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. It can confirm the presence of intrinsic spinal cord damage, compression, or edema, which are the likely causes of this patient's symptoms. Other imaging modalities, such as CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-rays, are either less informative or invasive and do not directly address the suspected spinal cord injury."}

The hallmark of central cord syndrome is disproportionately greater motor and sensory impairment in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities, with preserved anal sensation and tone. The patient's midline cervical tenderness and neurologic deficits suggest a cervical spine injury, necessitating imaging to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is used to evaluate vascular injuries, such as vertebral or carotid artery dissection, that can occur with cervical trauma. It provides detailed visualization of the vasculature.\n- **Weaknesses**: This test does not directly assess the spinal cord or bony structures for trauma-related changes. It would not confirm the cause of the patient\u2019s neurologic findings, which are more likely due to central cord syndrome rather than vascular injury.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the best choice for this scenario.\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal and then performing imaging (usually CT) to evaluate for spinal cord compression, nerve root impingement, or other abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: Cervical myelography is rarely used in modern practice because MRI provides superior visualization of the spinal cord, soft tissues, and surrounding structures without requiring invasive contrast injection. It is generally reserved for patients who cannot undergo MRI.\n- **Conclusion**: Less appropriate than MRI for this case.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick and can identify gross bony abnormalities, such as fractures, dislocations, or misalignments.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays have limited sensitivity for soft tissue injuries, spinal cord pathology, and subtle fractures. They cannot visualize the spinal cord itself or confirm central cord syndrome.\n- **Conclusion**: Insufficient to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed imaging of the spinal cord, soft tissues, ligaments, intervertebral discs, and any edema, hemorrhage, or compression. It is the most appropriate test to confirm central cord syndrome and assess for other spinal cord pathologies.\n- **Weaknesses**: MRI requires more time and resources than X-ray or CT, but its diagnostic yield is far superior for this type of injury.\n- **Conclusion**: The best choice to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n1. **Central Cord Syndrome**: Typically caused by hyperextension injuries in elderly patients with pre-existing cervical spondylosis. MRI is the best modality to confirm the diagnosis by showing spinal cord edema or hemorrhage.\n2. **Imaging Hierarchy**: While X-rays and CTs are useful for bony injuries, MRI is superior for soft tissue and spinal cord evaluation.\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s neurologic findings (upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits, preserved lower extremity function, and intact anal tone) are classic for central cord syndrome, which is most effectively diagnosed with MRI. MRI can identify spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression, confirming the cause of the neurologic deficits. Other options (CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-ray) are either less sensitive or less relevant for this specific clinical presentation."}
