Define the formula for ARR (Subtask 1).\n2. Calculate risk in the intervention group (\\(Ri\\)) (Subtask 2).\n3. Calculate risk in the control group (\\(Rc\\)) (Subtask 3).\n4. Compute the absolute risk reduction (\\(ARR\\)) (Subtask 4).\n5. Match the calculated ARR to the correct option (Subtask 5).\n6.
