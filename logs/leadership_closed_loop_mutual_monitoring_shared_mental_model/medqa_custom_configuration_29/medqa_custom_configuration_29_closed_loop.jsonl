It will be 16 times greater**. This conclusion is based on the application of **Poiseuille's Law**, which states that resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius. A 50% stenosis corresponds to halving the radius of the artery, leading to an increase in resistance by \\(2^4 = 16\\) times. \n\n#### Key Supporting Points:\n1. **Clinical Context**: The patient\u2019s symptoms (transient right-sided weakness, sensory changes, difficulty forming sentences, and prior painless visual loss) are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which are commonly caused by embolic events originating from stenotic carotid arteries. The Doppler findings of 50% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery confirm the likely source of emboli.\n\n2. **Physiological Principles**: The exponential relationship between vessel radius and resistance, as governed by Poiseuille\u2019s Law, predicts that halving the radius results in a 16-fold increase in resistance. This aligns with the degree of stenosis and the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\n3. **Systematic Option Evaluation**: \n   - **Option A (4 times greater)** and **Option B (8 times greater)** underestimate the impact of a 50% reduction in radius, failing to account for the fourth-power relationship.\n   - **Option D (No change)** is incorrect, as stenosis unequivocally increases resistance.\n   - **Option C (16 times greater)** is mathematically and physiologically accurate.\n\n4. **Consensus Across Analyses**: All teammates independently arrived at the same conclusion, reinforcing the robustness of this answer.\n\n### Addressing Feedback:\nThe Creative Strategist\u2019s analysis contained a minor contradiction, suggesting **A** in one part but ultimately selecting **C**. This issue has been acknowledged and clarified, as the correct application of Poiseuille\u2019s Law supports **C**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best-supported answer is **C**, based on the principles of fluid dynamics, the clinical presentation, and the diagnostic findings.

It will be 16 times greater**. This conclusion is supported by a thorough application of Poiseuille's Law and a shared understanding of the task objectives.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Integration of Insights:**\n\n#### **1. Analysis of the Question:**\n- The patient\u2019s symptoms (rapid-onset right-sided weakness, sensory changes, and difficulty forming sentences) are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), likely caused by embolic events originating from the stenotic left internal carotid artery (50% stenosis).\n- The painless visual loss (amaurosis fugax) 3 months ago further supports transient ischemia due to carotid artery disease.\n\n#### **2. Application of Poiseuille's Law:**\n- **Key Principle:** Resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel:\n  \\[\n  R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n  \\]\n- A 50% stenosis means the radius is halved (\\(r \\to 0.5r\\)). According to the fourth-power relationship:\n  \\[\n  R = \\frac{1}{(0.5)^4} = 16\n  \\]\n- This exponential increase in resistance (16 times) is the expected change in the stenotic artery.\n\n#### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Options:**\n- **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n  - Incorrect. This underestimates the increase in resistance, as Poiseuille\u2019s Law predicts a much larger change for a halving of the radius.\n- **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n  - Incorrect. While closer to the expected value, this still underestimates the exponential relationship.\n- **Option C: It will be 16 times greater**\n  - Correct. This aligns with the fourth-power relationship of radius to resistance and is mathematically consistent with Poiseuille\u2019s Law.\n- **Option D: No change**\n  - Incorrect. Stenosis unequivocally increases resistance by reducing the vessel radius.\n\n#### **4. Resolution of Team Feedback Issues:**\n- **Critical Analyst and Creative Strategist Contradictions:** Both teammates inadvertently referenced Option A in their initial observations but ultimately selected **C** as the correct answer. This discrepancy was likely a typographical error and does not undermine their reasoning, which consistently supports **C**.\n\n#### **5. Shared Team Understanding:**\n- All team members agree that the patient\u2019s symptoms are due to increased resistance in the left internal carotid artery caused by 50% stenosis.\n- Using Poiseuille\u2019s Law, a radius reduction of 50% leads to a 16-fold increase in resistance, making **C** the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision Criteria:**\n- **Option Analysis:** Systematic evaluation of each option shows that only **C** aligns with the principles of fluid dynamics.\n- **Evidence Evaluation:** The patient\u2019s clinical history, diagnostic findings, and Poiseuille\u2019s Law all support **C**.\n- **Clear Selection:** **C** is explicitly chosen as the best answer.\n- **Reasoning Quality:** The rationale is grounded in mathematical principles and clinical relevance.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is **C.
