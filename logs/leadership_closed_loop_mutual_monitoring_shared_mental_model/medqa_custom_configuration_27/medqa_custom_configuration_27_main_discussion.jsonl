This was clarified and did not affect the final outcome. All team members aligned on the correct selection of **Option C**.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Reasoning Quality**\nThe selection of **Option C (3.75%)** is supported by:\n- Accurate data extraction and formula application.\n- Consistency across all team analyses.\n- Logical reasoning based on statistical principles and clinical relevance.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) quantifies the difference in risk between the control group and the treatment group.
