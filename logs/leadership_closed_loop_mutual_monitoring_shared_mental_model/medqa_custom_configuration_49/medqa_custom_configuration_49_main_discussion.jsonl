These findings are classic for **intussusception**, a condition in which one segment of the bowel telescopes into another, causing bowel obstruction and ischemia. Early diagnosis is critical to avoid complications such as bowel necrosis or perforation. The next best diagnostic test should focus on confirming this suspected diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful for diagnosing systemic infections like sepsis or bacteremia, which can present with vomiting and abdominal pain in infants.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s symptoms (colicky abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, currant jelly stool, and a palpable abdominal mass) are highly suggestive of intussusception, not a systemic infection. Blood cultures would not confirm the diagnosis of intussusception and are not the next best step in this scenario.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the best diagnostic test for this clinical presentation.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: A KUB radiograph is a simple imaging modality that can identify bowel obstruction or perforation. It may show signs of intussusception, such as a \"target sign\" or \"crescent sign.\"\n- **Weaknesses**: While it can provide indirect evidence of intussusception, a KUB radiograph is not the most sensitive or specific test for diagnosing intussusception. It may miss the diagnosis if findings are subtle or absent. More definitive imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound, is preferred in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: This test is not the most accurate or reliable for confirming intussusception.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can provide information about anemia, infection, or inflammation, which may be relevant in cases of bowel ischemia or systemic infection.\n- **Weaknesses**: A CBC does not directly diagnose intussusception. While it may reveal anemia from blood loss or leukocytosis from inflammation, these findings are nonspecific and do not confirm the underlying condition. This test is not the next best step.\n- **Conclusion**: This test is not diagnostic for intussusception and is not the most appropriate next step.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Abdominal ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice for intussusception. It is highly sensitive and specific, and it can directly visualize the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign,\" which are characteristic findings of intussusception. It is non-invasive, quick, and widely available.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context. Ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing intussusception in children.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most appropriate test for confirming the suspected diagnosis of intussusception.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\n\n**Correct Answer: D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n\nThe clinical presentation strongly suggests intussusception, and abdominal ultrasound is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for this condition. It can confirm the diagnosis by identifying the characteristic findings (e.g., \"target sign\") and guide subsequent management, such as air or contrast enema reduction. Other options (A, B, and C) are either not directly diagnostic for intussusception or are less effective in confirming the diagnosis."}

These findings are highly suggestive of **intussusception**, a condition in which part of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction, ischemia, and potentially bowel necrosis.\n\nKey clinical features supporting this diagnosis:\n1. **Intermittent abdominal pain** (colicky in nature).\n2. **Bilious vomiting** indicating intestinal obstruction.\n3. **Currant jelly stool** (bloody and mucous-filled stools), a classic sign of intussusception.\n4. **Palpable abdominal mass** in the right lower quadrant, often described as \"sausage-shaped.\"\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **A. Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful in cases of suspected systemic infection or sepsis.\n- **Weaknesses**: This test does not address the primary issue of intestinal obstruction or intussusception. While intussusception can lead to complications like infection or sepsis, the next best step is to confirm the diagnosis with imaging rather than checking for secondary complications.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate as the next best diagnostic test.\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: A plain abdominal radiograph can show signs of bowel obstruction, such as air-fluid levels or dilated bowel loops. In some cases, it may show a \"target sign\" or \"crescent sign\" suggestive of intussusception.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB radiographs are less sensitive and specific for diagnosing intussusception compared to ultrasound. They may miss the telescoping bowel segments or fail to provide definitive findings.\n- **Conclusion**: While it may provide some indirect clues, it is not the best diagnostic test for confirming intussusception.\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can identify anemia, infection, or leukocytosis, which may support the presence of inflammation or ischemia in complicated intussusception.\n- **Weaknesses**: A CBC does not directly diagnose intussusception. It provides ancillary information but does not address the immediate need to confirm the diagnosis.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate as the next best diagnostic test.\n\n#### **D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Abdominal ultrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice for intussusception. It is highly sensitive and specific, often showing the characteristic \"target sign\" or \"donut sign\" representing the telescoped bowel segments. It is non-invasive, readily available, and does not involve radiation.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context.\n- **Conclusion**: The best diagnostic test to confirm intussusception.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven the clinical presentation, intussusception is the most likely diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing this condition due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It provides direct visualization of the telescoped bowel segments (target sign) and can guide further management, such as air or saline enema reduction. Other tests (blood cultures, CBC, KUB radiograph) may provide ancillary information but are not the next best step to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n"}

A palpable mass in the right lower quadrant is also noted on physical exam. These findings are classic for **intussusception**, a condition in which part of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction and compromised blood flow.\n\nThe next step in managing this patient is to confirm the diagnosis using the most appropriate diagnostic test.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful in diagnosing systemic infections such as sepsis or bacteremia, which can cause vomiting and abdominal pain.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no indication of systemic infection (e.g., fever, hemodynamic instability) in this patient. Blood cultures do not help in diagnosing intussusception, which is the likely diagnosis here. \n- **Conclusion**: This is not the best diagnostic test for this clinical scenario.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: KUB radiographs can identify obstruction or perforation (e.g., free air under the diaphragm) and may show indirect signs of intussusception, such as a \"target sign\" or \"crescent sign.\"\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB radiographs are less sensitive and specific for intussusception compared to abdominal ultrasound. They may miss the diagnosis entirely or provide inconclusive results. \n- **Conclusion**: While KUB radiographs have some utility, they are not the best diagnostic test for intussusception.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can provide insight into infection, anemia, or inflammation, which may be secondary to the patient's condition.\n- **Weaknesses**: A CBC is not diagnostic for intussusception. It may show nonspecific findings such as leukocytosis or anemia due to blood loss, but it does not confirm or rule out intussusception.\n- **Conclusion**: While a CBC may be helpful in assessing the patient's overall condition, it is not the best diagnostic test for this clinical scenario.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing intussusception. It is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific. Classic findings include the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign,\" which represent the telescoped bowel segments.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context. Ultrasound is widely available and safe for pediatric patients.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the best diagnostic test for intussusception in this patient.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\n1. **Diagnostic Accuracy**: The diagnostic test should provide the most accurate and confirmatory information for the suspected condition. Abdominal ultrasound is the most sensitive and specific test for intussusception.\n2. **Minimally Invasive Approach**: For pediatric patients, non-invasive tests are preferred. Ultrasound is non-invasive and does not expose the child to radiation, unlike a KUB radiograph.\n3. **Clinical Presentation Alignment**: The clinical findings (bilious vomiting, \"jelly-like\" stool, palpable abdominal mass) strongly suggest intussusception, and ultrasound directly addresses this suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Correct Answer: D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation is highly suggestive of intussusception, and abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate next diagnostic test. It is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific for this condition, making it the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis.
