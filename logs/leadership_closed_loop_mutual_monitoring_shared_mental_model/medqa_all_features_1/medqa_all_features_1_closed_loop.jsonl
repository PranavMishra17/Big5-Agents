Oral erythromycin**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThis case describes a 13-day-old neonate with **mucoid ocular discharge, eyelid swelling, cough, nasal discharge**, and chest radiograph findings of **hyperinflation with bilateral infiltrates**. The clinical scenario strongly suggests **neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum)** caused by **Chlamydia trachomatis**, complicated by **chlamydial pneumonia**. \n\nKey reasoning:\n1. **Etiology**: The timing of symptoms (13 days post-birth) and the mucoid nature of the ocular discharge are classic for **Chlamydia trachomatis**. Earlier-onset conjunctivitis (2\u20135 days) would suggest **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**, which is less likely in this case, especially given the administration of silver nitrate drops at birth.\n2. **Systemic involvement**: The respiratory symptoms and chest radiograph findings (hyperinflation, bilateral infiltrates) are consistent with **chlamydial pneumonia**, a known complication of perinatal chlamydial infection.\n3. **Treatment goals**: The pharmacotherapy must address both the **ocular symptoms** (conjunctivitis) and the **systemic infection** (pneumonia).\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of Options:\n\n#### **Option A: Artificial tears**\n- **Strengths**: Provides symptomatic relief for mild ocular irritation.\n- **Weaknesses**: Does not address the infectious cause or systemic involvement (pneumonia). \n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect, as it fails to treat the underlying infection.\n\n#### **Option B: Topical erythromycin**\n- **Strengths**: Effective for localized bacterial conjunctivitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Insufficient for systemic infection. Neonatal chlamydial infections require **systemic therapy** to address both conjunctivitis and pneumonia.\n- **Conclusion**: Suboptimal choice due to the systemic nature of the infection.\n\n#### **Option C: Oral erythromycin**\n- **Strengths**: Oral erythromycin is the **first-line treatment** for neonatal chlamydial infections. It addresses both **ocular** and **systemic symptoms**, including pneumonia. This is supported by evidence-based guidelines.\n- **Weaknesses**: Risk of **infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)**, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: Correct choice, as it treats both conjunctivitis and systemic pneumonia.\n\n#### **Option D: Intravenous acyclovir**\n- **Strengths**: Effective for neonatal **herpes simplex virus (HSV)** infections.\n- **Weaknesses**: The clinical presentation does not suggest HSV (no vesicular lesions, keratitis, or CNS involvement).
