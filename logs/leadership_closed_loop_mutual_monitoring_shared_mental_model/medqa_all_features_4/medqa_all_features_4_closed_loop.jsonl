Alcohol**: The patient\u2019s reported alcohol consumption (\u22642 drinks/day) is minimal and unlikely to contribute to RPN. Alcohol is not a recognized direct cause of this condition.\n   - **B. Antihypertensives**: While hypertension itself can lead to chronic kidney disease, there is no direct association between antihypertensive medications and RPN. The patient\u2019s hypertension appears to be well-managed, with no evidence of CKD in this case.\n   - **C. Pain medicine**: Chronic use of NSAIDs, a common component of over-the-counter pain medicines, is a well-documented cause of RPN. NSAIDs impair renal perfusion by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, leading to ischemic damage to the renal papillae. The patient\u2019s history of kidney stones and low back pain suggests frequent NSAID use, even if not explicitly stated. This makes pain medicine the most plausible contributing factor.\n   - **D. Proton pump inhibitor**: While PPIs are associated with chronic kidney disease and acute interstitial nephritis, they are not directly linked to RPN. The clinical presentation and imaging findings do not align with PPI-related kidney injury.\n\n3. **Evidence Synthesis**:\n   - The CT findings of \"ring shadows in the medullae\" strongly suggest RPN, which is most commonly associated with NSAID use.\n   - The patient\u2019s history of kidney stones and low back pain increases the likelihood of frequent NSAID use, even if the specific type of pain medicine is not explicitly confirmed.\n\n4. **Consensus Across Team Members**:\n   - All team members, including the Domain Expert, Creative Strategist, and Process Facilitator, identified **C.

Likely Diagnosis: Renal Papillary Necrosis**\n- The patient\u2019s clinical presentation (severe flank pain, fever, chills, costovertebral angle tenderness, and gross hematuria) combined with the CT finding of **ring shadows in the medullae** is highly suggestive of **renal papillary necrosis (RPN)**.\n- RPN is characterized by ischemic necrosis of the renal papillae and is strongly associated with chronic analgesic use (especially NSAIDs), diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease/trait, urinary tract obstruction, and infections like pyelonephritis.\n\n#### **2. Systematic Analysis of the Options**\n- **A. Alcohol**: While alcohol can contribute to dehydration and kidney damage in heavy drinkers, this patient\u2019s social drinking (\u22642 drinks/day) is insufficient to explain the pathology. Alcohol is not directly associated with renal papillary necrosis.\n- **B.

The patient\u2019s symptoms and imaging findings do not align with PPI-related kidney injury.\n\n#### **3. Supporting Evidence**\n- The patient\u2019s history of **kidney stones** and **low back pain** suggests he may use pain medications frequently, even if he does not recall the specific names. NSAIDs are commonly used in such scenarios.\n- The CT finding of **ring shadows in the medullae** is a hallmark of RPN, which is most strongly linked to chronic NSAID use among the options provided.\n\n#### **4.
