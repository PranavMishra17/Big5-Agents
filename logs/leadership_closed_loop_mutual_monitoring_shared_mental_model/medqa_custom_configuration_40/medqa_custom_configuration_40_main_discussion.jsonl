Denver is located at a higher altitude (~5,280 feet) compared to New York City (near sea level). At higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, resulting in reduced partial pressure of oxygen (PO\u2082). This creates hypoxic conditions that trigger compensatory mechanisms in the body.\n\nKey physiological responses to moving to a high-altitude environment include:\n1. **Erythropoietin (EPO) Levels**: Hypoxia stimulates the kidneys to produce erythropoietin, which promotes red blood cell production to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.\n2. **Oxygen Saturation (O\u2082 Saturation)**: At high altitudes, oxygen saturation decreases due to the lower availability of oxygen in the air.\n3. **Plasma Volume**: Plasma volume tends to remain unchanged in the short term (1 week), although long-term altitude exposure may lead to reductions.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **Option A: Unchanged \u2193 unchanged**\n- **Strengths**: The decrease in oxygen saturation is consistent with hypoxia at high altitudes.\n- **Weaknesses**: Erythropoietin levels are unlikely to remain unchanged.
