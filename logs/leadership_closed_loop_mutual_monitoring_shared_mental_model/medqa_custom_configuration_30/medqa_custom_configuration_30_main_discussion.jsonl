Imaging is essential for diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: Useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral artery dissection or other vascular abnormalities, which can occur with cervical spine trauma.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s neurologic findings are more consistent with spinal cord injury rather than vascular compromise. CT angiography does not provide adequate detail of the spinal cord itself, making it less useful for diagnosing the cause of central cord syndrome.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the best choice for this scenario.\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots. Historically, it was used to diagnose spinal cord compression.\n- **Weaknesses**: This is an outdated modality largely replaced by MRI, which provides superior visualization of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, without requiring invasive contrast injection. Myelography is rarely used unless MRI is contraindicated.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the preferred diagnostic tool in modern practice.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: Useful for identifying bony fractures or alignment issues in the cervical spine.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays do not provide detailed visualization of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, and would not confirm the cause of neurologic deficits such as central cord syndrome. While X-rays may identify fractures, they are insufficient to evaluate spinal cord injury.\n- **Conclusion**: Inadequate for confirming the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed imaging of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and ligaments. It is particularly useful for identifying central cord syndrome, spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression from bone fragments or disc herniation.\n- **Weaknesses**: None relevant to this scenario. MRI without contrast is appropriate in trauma cases unless there is a suspicion of infection or malignancy requiring contrast enhancement.\n- **Conclusion**: The best choice for confirming the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation is highly suggestive of **central cord syndrome**, a type of incomplete spinal cord injury often seen in elderly patients after hyperextension injuries to the cervical spine. MRI of the cervical spine is the most effective modality to confirm the diagnosis by visualizing the spinal cord for edema, hemorrhage, or compression. It is superior to other imaging modalities in assessing soft tissue injuries and spinal cord pathology.\n\n"}

The findings of diminished strength and sensation (pain and temperature) in the upper extremities, absent upper extremity reflexes, and intact lower extremity function suggest a **central cord syndrome**. This is likely due to cervical spinal cord injury, commonly seen in older adults with pre-existing cervical spondylosis following hyperextension injuries.\n\nThe goal is to determine the imaging modality that will best confirm the cause of the patient's neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option\n\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography (CTA) is useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral or carotid artery dissection, which can occur with cervical trauma. It is also fast and widely available.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with spinal cord injury rather than vascular injury. While CTA may rule out vascular causes, it will not provide detailed information about the spinal cord or soft tissue structures.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the best choice for evaluating the suspected spinal cord injury.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Cervical myelography involves injecting contrast into the subarachnoid space to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can detect spinal cord compression and is an alternative for patients who cannot undergo MRI.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is invasive, requiring lumbar puncture and contrast injection. It has largely been replaced by MRI, which provides superior detail of spinal cord pathology and is non-invasive.\n- **Conclusion**: While it could theoretically confirm the diagnosis, it is not the preferred or most practical option.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick and inexpensive, and they can identify fractures, dislocations, or significant degenerative changes in the cervical spine.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays provide limited information about soft tissue structures, including the spinal cord. They cannot evaluate the spinal cord injury or central cord syndrome, which is the suspected diagnosis in this patient.\n- **Conclusion**: X-rays are insufficient to confirm the cause of the patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides excellent visualization of the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and soft tissues. It can confirm central cord syndrome by showing spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression.\n- **Weaknesses**: MRI is less accessible in some settings and may take longer to perform than CT. However, these limitations are outweighed by its diagnostic utility in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: MRI is the best choice to confirm the suspected spinal cord injury and diagnose central cord syndrome.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles\n- **Mechanism of Injury**: The hyperextension injury in an elderly patient with likely cervical spondylosis predisposes to central cord syndrome.\n- **Localization of Neurologic Deficits**: The upper extremity involvement with sparing of the lower extremities is classic for central cord syndrome.\n- **Imaging Modality of Choice**: MRI is the most sensitive and specific modality for diagnosing spinal cord injuries and soft tissue abnormalities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale\nMRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings. It will allow detailed evaluation of the spinal cord, including any edema, hemorrhage, or compression, which are hallmarks of central cord syndrome. None of the other options provide the same level of diagnostic accuracy for soft tissue and spinal cord pathology."}
