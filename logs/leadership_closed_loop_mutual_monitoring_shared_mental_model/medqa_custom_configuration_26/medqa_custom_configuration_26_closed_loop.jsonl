These symptoms require immediate attention to stabilize the patient.\n   - Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is highly effective in providing rapid symptomatic relief by controlling heart rate, reducing tremors, and alleviating palpitations.\n\n2. **Mechanism and Additional Benefits**:\n   - Propranolol also inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, which provides short-term relief from excessive thyroid hormone activity.\n   - This dual mechanism makes propranolol a critical first-line intervention for symptomatic thyrotoxicosis.\n\n3. **Stepwise Management**:\n   - While methimazole (option C) is essential for definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism, it does not provide immediate relief of acute symptoms. Methimazole can be initiated after stabilization with propranolol.\n   - Anticoagulation (option B, Warfarin) is not the immediate priority because treating the hyperthyroidism often resolves atrial fibrillation.\n   - Propylthiouracil (option A) is not preferred due to its higher risk of hepatotoxicity and is reserved for specific situations (e.g., pregnancy, thyroid storm).\n\n4. **Consensus Alignment**:\n   - All team members agree that propranolol is the most appropriate next step based on its ability to stabilize the patient acutely while allowing time for definitive management of the underlying hyperthyroidism.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPropranolol addresses the urgent need for symptom control and stabilization in this patient with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation.
