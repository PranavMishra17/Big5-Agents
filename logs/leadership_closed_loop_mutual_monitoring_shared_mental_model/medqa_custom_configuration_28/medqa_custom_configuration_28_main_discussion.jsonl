To answer, we need to consider the pharmacokinetics of each drug, particularly their duration of action.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options\n#### **A. Mepivacaine**\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Mepivacaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with an intermediate duration of action, generally lasting longer than lidocaine but shorter than etidocaine.\n- **Strengths**: Provides effective analgesia with moderate duration, commonly used for procedures requiring longer-lasting effects.\n- **Weaknesses**: Not the shortest-acting anesthetic among the options.\n\n#### **B. Chloroprocaine**\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic with a very short duration of action due to rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases.\n- **Strengths**: Specifically designed for short procedures, making it the shortest-acting anesthetic in this list.\n- **Weaknesses**: Limited duration of analgesia may not be ideal for longer procedures.\n\n#### **C. Lidocaine**\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a relatively short duration of action, but longer than chloroprocaine.\n- **Strengths**: Widely used due to its reliability and safety profile.\n- **Weaknesses**: Not the shortest-acting anesthetic in this list.\n\n#### **D. Etidocaine**\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Etidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a long duration of action.\n- **Strengths**: Useful for procedures requiring prolonged analgesia.\n- **Weaknesses**: Clearly not the shortest-acting anesthetic among the options.\n\n### Relevant Principles\n1. **Ester vs. Amide Metabolism**: Ester-type anesthetics (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized quickly by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations of action compared to amide-type anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine), which rely on hepatic metabolism.\n2. **Clinical Context**: In this case, the goal is to provide short-term analgesia for incision and drainage of an abscess. Chloroprocaine is most suitable due to its rapid onset and short duration of action.\n\n### Selection\n**Correct Answer: B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n### Rationale\nChloroprocaine has the shortest duration of analgesia among the listed local anesthetics, making it ideal for a brief procedure like incision and drainage of an abscess. Its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases ensures minimal residual effects, aligning with the clinical requirements of this scenario."}

To answer this, we need to consider the pharmacokinetics of the drugs listed, particularly their **duration of action**, which depends on factors such as protein binding, lipid solubility, and metabolism.\n\n#### Option A: Mepivacaine\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Mepivacaine is an amide-type local anesthetic. It has an intermediate duration of action, typically lasting **2\u20133 hours** when used for infiltration anesthesia.\n- **Strengths**: Provides reliable analgesia and is less vasodilatory than lidocaine, which can prolong its effect slightly.\n- **Weaknesses**: Its duration of action is longer than chloroprocaine, making it unsuitable as the shortest-acting anesthetic.\n\n#### Option B: Chloroprocaine\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic. It has a **very short duration of action**, typically lasting **30\u201360 minutes** when used for infiltration anesthesia.\n- **Strengths**: Rapid onset and short duration make it ideal for procedures requiring minimal analgesia time. Ester-type anesthetics are metabolized quickly by plasma cholinesterases.\n- **Weaknesses**: Short duration may not be sufficient for more prolonged procedures, but this is not relevant to the current scenario.\n\n#### Option C: Lidocaine\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a **moderate duration of action**, typically lasting **1\u20132 hours** for infiltration anesthesia.\n- **Strengths**: Widely used due to its efficacy and safety profile.\n- **Weaknesses**: Its duration of action is longer than chloroprocaine, making it less suitable as the shortest-acting anesthetic.\n\n#### Option D: Etidocaine\n- **Pharmacokinetics**: Etidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a **long duration of action**, typically lasting **4\u20138 hours** for infiltration anesthesia.\n- **Strengths**: Provides prolonged analgesia, which is useful for extended procedures.\n- **Weaknesses**: Its long duration of action makes it unsuitable for situations requiring short-term analgesia.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Principles:\n1. **Ester vs. Amide Local Anesthetics**: Ester-type anesthetics (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized rapidly by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations of action compared to amide-type anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine), which are metabolized in the liver.\n2. **Clinical Context**: The patient requires a short-acting local anesthetic for a minor procedure (incision and drainage of an abscess). Chloroprocaine is ideal for this purpose due to its rapid metabolism and short duration of action.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe local anesthetic with the shortest duration of analgesia is **chloroprocaine**.\n\n**Correct Answer: B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n**Rationale**: Chloroprocaine has the shortest duration of action (30\u201360 minutes) among the options provided, making it the most appropriate choice for this clinical scenario. Its rapid onset and brief duration are well-suited for minor procedures like abscess drainage."}
