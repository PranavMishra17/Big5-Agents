Among these, **LDL cholesterol is the primary therapeutic target** for cardiovascular risk reduction.\n   - According to ACC/AHA guidelines, patients with LDL \u2265 190 mg/dL or those with high cardiovascular risk (as in this case) should be started on high-intensity statin therapy.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular Risk**:\n   - The patient has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease (father died of a heart attack at 61). These factors place him at **high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.\n   - Statins have robust evidence for reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.\n\n---\n\n### **Option Evaluation:**\n\n#### **A. Atorvastatin** (Selected Option)\n- **Mechanism**: High-intensity statin that lowers LDL cholesterol and provides pleiotropic cardiovascular benefits, such as anti-inflammatory effects and plaque stabilization.\n- **Benefits**:\n  - Targets the primary issue: elevated LDL cholesterol, the strongest driver of ASCVD risk in this patient.\n  - Modestly lowers triglycerides and may slightly improve HDL cholesterol.\n  - Supported by strong evidence and guidelines for primary prevention in high-risk patients.\n- **Risks**: Minimal in this context, as statins are well-tolerated and widely recommended.\n\n#### **B. Niacin**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Can increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides, which are secondary concerns in this patient.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Not first-line therapy for dyslipidemia.\n  - Limited evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction compared to statins.\n  - Side effects (e.g., flushing, hepatotoxicity) make it less favorable.\n\n#### **C. Gemfibrozil**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Effective at lowering triglycerides and modestly increasing HDL cholesterol.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Primarily indicated for severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL), which is not the case here.\n  - Does not address the primary issue of elevated LDL cholesterol.\n  - Increased risk of myopathy when combined with statins.\n\n#### **D.
