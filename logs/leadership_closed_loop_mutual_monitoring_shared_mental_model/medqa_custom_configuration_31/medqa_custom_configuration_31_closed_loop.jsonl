This decision is supported by the following points:\n\n1. **Clinical Diagnosis**: The patient\u2019s symptoms of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, combined with a negative pregnancy test (\u00df-HCG negative) and guaiac-negative nipple discharge, strongly suggest **hyperprolactinemia** as the underlying cause. Hyperprolactinemia is commonly associated with prolactinomas, medications, or other systemic conditions.\n\n2. **Mechanism of Action**: Cabergoline is a **dopamine agonist** that directly inhibits prolactin secretion by stimulating dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary. This mechanism effectively addresses the root cause of hyperprolactinemia, making Cabergoline the first-line treatment.\n\n3. **Evidence-Based Practice**: Clinical guidelines and evidence consistently recommend **dopamine agonists**, such as Cabergoline, as the gold standard for treating hyperprolactinemia. Cabergoline is preferred over bromocriptine due to its higher efficacy, longer half-life, and better tolerability.\n\n4. **Systematic Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option A (Tamoxifen)**: Tamoxifen is irrelevant to the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea. It does not address the underlying hormonal imbalance.\n   - **Option B (Haloperidol)**: Haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, could worsen hyperprolactinemia and exacerbate the patient\u2019s symptoms. It is contraindicated in this scenario.\n   - **Option D (Carbidopa-levodopa)**: While it increases dopamine levels in the brain, Carbidopa-levodopa is not indicated for hyperprolactinemia and does not specifically target prolactin secretion.\n\n5. **Consensus Among Team Members**: All analyses converge on Cabergoline (Option C) as the optimal therapy.
