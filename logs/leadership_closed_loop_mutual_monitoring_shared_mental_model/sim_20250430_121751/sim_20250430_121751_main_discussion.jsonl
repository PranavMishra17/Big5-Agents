It is emitted in large quantities through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. CO2 has a long atmospheric lifetime, meaning it accumulates over time, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. It is the primary focus of climate mitigation policies due to its dominant role in anthropogenic emissions.\n- **Weaknesses:** While other gases like methane and nitrous oxide have higher global warming potentials (GWP) per molecule, CO2's sheer volume of emissions makes it the most impactful overall.\n\n### **Option B: Methane (CH4)**\n- **Strengths:** Methane has a much higher GWP than CO2, meaning it is more effective at trapping heat per molecule. It is released through agricultural practices (e.g., livestock), landfills, and fossil fuel extraction. Methane also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime (~12 years), which makes it a potent but transient contributor to warming.\n- **Weaknesses:** Despite its higher GWP, methane is emitted in smaller quantities compared to CO2. Its shorter lifetime also means its long-term impact is less significant than CO2.\n\n### **Option C: Water vapor (H2O)**\n- **Strengths:** Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and plays a key role in the natural greenhouse effect. It amplifies warming through feedback mechanisms\u2014higher temperatures lead to more evaporation and increased water vapor, which traps more heat.\n- **Weaknesses:** Water vapor is not directly emitted by human activities in significant quantities. Its concentration is primarily controlled by temperature, making it a feedback rather than a direct driver of human-induced climate change.\n\n### **Option D: Nitrous oxide (N2O)**\n- **Strengths:** Nitrous oxide has a high GWP and a long atmospheric lifetime (~114 years). It is emitted through agricultural activities (e.g., fertilizer use), industrial processes, and combustion of fossil fuels and biomass.\n- **Weaknesses:** N2O is emitted in much smaller quantities compared to CO2 and methane, making its overall contribution to human-induced climate change less significant.\n\n---\n\n**Relevant Principles:**\n- **Volume vs. Potency:** While some greenhouse gases (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide) have higher GWPs, the sheer volume of CO2 emissions makes it the primary driver of human-induced climate change.\n- **Direct Emissions:** CO2 is directly emitted by human activities at a scale far exceeding other greenhouse gases.\n- **Longevity:** CO2's long atmospheric lifetime ensures its cumulative impact on climate is significant.\n\n---\n\n**Correct Selection:**\n**A. Carbon dioxide (CO2)**\n\n**Rationale:**\nCarbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for human-induced climate change due to its dominant role in anthropogenic emissions, long atmospheric lifetime, and significant cumulative impact. While other gases like methane and nitrous oxide contribute to warming, their smaller emission volumes and shorter lifetimes make their overall impact less substantial in comparison to CO2. Water vapor, while important in natural climate processes, is a feedback mechanism rather than a direct driver of human-induced changes."}
