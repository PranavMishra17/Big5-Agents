This option is immediately ruled out because the patient has a pH of 7.52, which is outside the normal range (7.35\u20137.45). The ABG clearly indicates an acid-base disturbance.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient has alkalosis, so \"normal acid-base status\" is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low HCO3-, which is mildly decreased in this patient (21 mEq/L). However, the primary disturbance is not metabolic acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** The pH is elevated (alkalosis), whereas metabolic acidosis would result in a decreased pH. The low PaCO2 strongly indicates a respiratory disturbance, not a metabolic one.\n\n#### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory acidosis is associated with an elevated PaCO2 and a decreased pH. This could occur in patients with hypoventilation or obstructive lung disease.\n- **Weaknesses:** The PaCO2 is low (28 mm Hg), not high, and the pH is elevated (7.52), ruling out respiratory acidosis.\n\n#### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a high pH and a low PaCO2, which matches this patient's ABG findings. The decreased HCO3- is likely compensatory, as the kidneys attempt to restore acid-base balance. This disturbance is consistent with hyperventilation, which is common in patients with pneumonia and hypoxemia.\n- **Weaknesses:** None. This option aligns well with the clinical and ABG findings.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\n1. **Primary Disturbance:** The elevated pH (7.52) indicates alkalosis. The low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) confirms a respiratory origin, as CO2 is being excessively exhaled due to hyperventilation.\n2. **Compensation:** The mildly decreased HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is consistent with renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis.\n3. **Clinical Context:** Pneumonia and hypoxemia likely triggered hyperventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This is a common acid-base disturbance in patients with acute pulmonary infections.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**"}

His arterial blood gas (ABG) values reveal the following:\n\n- **Blood pH:** 7.52 (alkalosis)\n- **PaO2:** 74 mm Hg (hypoxemia)\n- **PaCO2:** 28 mm Hg (low, indicating hyperventilation)\n- **HCO3-:** 21 mEq/L (mildly decreased, likely compensatory)\n\nThese findings suggest an acid-base disturbance. Let's analyze each option systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths:** If the pH were within the normal range (7.35\u20137.45) and the PaCO2 and HCO3- were also normal, this would indicate no acid-base disturbance.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient has an elevated pH (alkalosis), low PaCO2 (indicating hyperventilation), and mildly decreased HCO3-. This is clearly not a normal acid-base status. Thus, this option can be ruled out.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a decreased pH (<7.35) and a primary decrease in HCO3-. It can occur due to conditions such as sepsis or lactic acidosis, which might be relevant in this patient with an infection and hypotension.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient\u2019s pH is elevated (7.52), ruling out acidosis. Although HCO3- is mildly decreased (21 mEq/L), this is likely a compensatory response to the primary alkalosis. Therefore, metabolic acidosis does not fit this clinical scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a decreased pH (<7.35) and an elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg), typically due to hypoventilation or respiratory failure.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient\u2019s pH is elevated (alkalosis), and PaCO2 is decreased (28 mm Hg), indicating hyperventilation rather than hypoventilation. This rules out respiratory acidosis.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by an elevated pH (>7.45) and a decreased PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg), typically due to hyperventilation. This fits the patient\u2019s ABG values: pH 7.52 (alkalosis) and PaCO2 28 mm Hg (low). The mildly decreased HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is consistent with renal compensation for chronic or sustained respiratory alkalosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** None. This option aligns with the clinical and laboratory findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Selected Option:**\nThe patient\u2019s ABG results (elevated pH, decreased PaCO2, and mildly decreased HCO3-) are best explained by **respiratory alkalosis**. This is likely due to hyperventilation caused by hypoxemia and respiratory distress from the suspected pneumonia.\n\n**Correct Answer: D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\n1. **Primary Disturbance:** Elevated pH and low PaCO2 indicate respiratory alkalosis as the primary disturbance.\n2. **Compensation:** The mildly decreased HCO3- reflects renal compensation for the alkalosis.\n3. **Clinical Context:** Hyperventilation is common in patients with pneumonia and hypoxemia, as they attempt to increase oxygen delivery by breathing faster.\n\nLet me know if clarification is needed!"}

Let\u2019s analyze each option systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Normal acid-base status would imply that the pH is within the normal range (7.35\u20137.45), with no significant disturbances in PaCO2 or HCO3- levels.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - The patient\u2019s pH is **7.52**, which is **alkalotic** (above the normal range). This immediately rules out normal acid-base status.\n  - Both PaCO2 (28 mm Hg, low) and HCO3- (21 mEq/L, slightly low) are abnormal, indicating a clear disturbance.\n\n**Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Metabolic acidosis would be characterized by a low pH (<7.35) and a low HCO3- (<22 mEq/L).

Additionally, the PaCO2 is low, which is more consistent with a respiratory cause.\n\n**Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Respiratory acidosis would be characterized by a low pH (<7.35) and an elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg), often due to hypoventilation.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - The pH is **elevated** (7.52), indicating alkalosis, not acidosis.\n  - The PaCO2 is **low** (28 mm Hg), which is the opposite of what we would expect in respiratory acidosis.\n\n**Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation, which leads to a decreased PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg). This fits the patient\u2019s ABG profile, as his PaCO2 is **28 mm Hg**.\n  - The elevated pH (7.52) is consistent with alkalosis.\n  - The slightly low HCO3- (21 mEq/L) suggests a compensatory metabolic response to the primary respiratory alkalosis.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - None. The clinical and ABG findings align perfectly with this diagnosis.\n\n**Conclusion**: This option is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Relevant Principles and Final Reasoning**\n- **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis**:\n  - pH > 7.45 indicates alkalosis.\n  - PaCO2 < 35 mm Hg suggests a respiratory cause for the alkalosis.\n  - HCO3- < 22 mEq/L would suggest a metabolic compensation for respiratory alkalosis.\n- **Clinical Context**:\n  - The patient\u2019s presentation (fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia with PaO2 of 74 mm Hg) is consistent with pneumonia. This can lead to hyperventilation due to hypoxemia, causing respiratory alkalosis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**: **D.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) values are provided: **pH 7.52**, **PaO2 74 mm Hg**, **PaCO2 28 mm Hg**, and **HCO3- 21 mEq/L**. The question asks to identify the acid-base disturbance.\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\n#### **Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths**: If the pH were within the normal range (7.35\u20137.45), this might indicate no acid-base disturbance.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH is elevated at **7.52**, clearly indicating **alkalosis**. Additionally, PaCO2 is reduced at **28 mm Hg**, and HCO3- is slightly decreased at **21 mEq/L**, confirming an acid-base imbalance. This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Metabolic acidosis is associated with a decreased HCO3- level and compensatory hyperventilation (low PaCO2). If the pH were low (<7.35), metabolic acidosis would be plausible.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH is elevated (**alkalosis**), not decreased. While HCO3- is slightly reduced, the primary disturbance is not metabolic but rather respiratory (as evidenced by the low PaCO2). This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory acidosis is characterized by elevated PaCO2 and decreased pH (<7.35). This could occur in conditions like hypoventilation or obstructive lung disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: The PaCO2 is **low** at 28 mm Hg, not elevated, and the pH is **high** (alkalosis), ruling out respiratory acidosis. This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by elevated pH (>7.45) and decreased PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg), which matches this patient\u2019s ABG values (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg). The decreased HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is likely a compensatory response to the primary respiratory disturbance.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This option aligns with the clinical and laboratory findings.\n\n### Relevant Principles\n1. **pH Interpretation**: A pH of 7.52 indicates alkalosis.\n2. **Primary Disturbance Identification**: PaCO2 is low, pointing to a respiratory cause (respiratory alkalosis).\n3. **Compensation**: The slightly reduced HCO3- suggests renal compensation for the respiratory alkalosis.\n4. **Clinical Context**: Fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which can lead to hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis due to hypoxemia or systemic inflammatory response.\n\n### Final Selection\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n### Rationale\nThe patient\u2019s ABG values (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg, HCO3- 21 mEq/L) and clinical presentation are consistent with **respiratory alkalosis**. The elevated pH and decreased PaCO2 confirm a primary respiratory disturbance, and the slightly reduced HCO3- reflects compensatory mechanisms.
