Glycine is directly implicated in tetanus pathophysiology.\n- **Relevance**: Perfect alignment with the clinical presentation and treatment.\n\n#### **B. Acetylcholine**\n- **Strengths**: Acetylcholine is involved in neuromuscular junction signaling and muscle contraction.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tetanospasmin does not directly affect acetylcholine release or function. The rigidity in tetanus is due to lack of inhibitory control, not acetylcholine dysfunction.\n- **Relevance**: Indirectly related but not central to tetanus pathology.\n\n#### **C.
