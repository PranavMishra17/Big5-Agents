Recent dietary changes are unlikely to account for the diagnosis.\n   - **Low-dose aspirin use**: Aspirin is generally protective against colorectal cancer rather than being a risk factor. This option is incorrect.\n   - **Naproxen use**: Naproxen, like aspirin, is not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

The incidence of CRC increases sharply after the age of 50, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over 65 years old. This patient is 72, placing him in a high-risk demographic.

The advanced age of the patient outweighs dietary habits in terms of overall impact on colorectal cancer risk. \n   - **Team Consensus**: This is a contributing factor but not the greatest risk factor.\n\n2. **Option B: Increasing age**\n   - Age is the most significant non-modifiable risk factor for colorectal cancer. The incidence of colorectal cancer rises significantly after age 50, and this patient, at 72 years old, falls into the highest risk category. Cellular aging and accumulated genetic mutations over time are key mechanisms driving this risk.\n   - **Team Consensus**: All team members agree that age is the dominant risk factor for this patient.\n\n3. **Option C: Low-dose aspirin use**\n   - Aspirin is generally associated with a protective effect against colorectal cancer due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

Epidemiological studies consistently show that the risk of colorectal cancer increases significantly with advancing age, particularly after 50 years.\n- Other factors, such as dietary fiber intake and medication use, are either less significant (dietary fiber) or protective (aspirin and naproxen) in this context.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clear Selection:**\n- The team unanimously agrees that **B.
