Mathematically, \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} \\), where \\( R \\) is resistance and \\( r \\) is the radius of the vessel. This means that even small changes in the radius of a vessel can lead to significant changes in resistance.\n\n2. **Clinical Context**: \n   - The patient presents with transient ischemic attack (TIA)-like symptoms (rapid onset of weakness, sensory loss, and language difficulty, resolving within minutes). His history of painless monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax) 3 months ago is highly suggestive of embolic phenomena, likely originating from the left internal carotid artery (ICA), which has 50% stenosis.\n   - The unremarkable CT scan and the Doppler findings support the hypothesis that the left ICA stenosis is the culprit vessel.\n\n3. **Task Interpretation**: The question asks for the expected change in resistance to blood flow in the stenotic artery responsible for the symptoms. Since the stenosis is 50%, the radius of the vessel is reduced to half its original value. Using Poiseuille's Law, the impact of this reduction on resistance can be calculated.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options\n\n#### **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: If the radius of the vessel were reduced to 71% of its original value (e.g., mild stenosis), resistance would increase by a factor of \\( \\frac{1}{(0.71)^4} \\approx 4 \\). \n- **Weaknesses**: In this case, the stenosis is 50%, meaning the radius is halved, which would result in a much greater increase in resistance. This option underestimates the impact of the stenosis.\n\n#### **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This could be plausible if the radius were reduced by a slightly larger proportion than 71% but less than 50%.\n- **Weaknesses**: A 50% reduction in radius would lead to a more significant increase in resistance than 8 times. This option still underestimates the impact.\n\n#### **Option C: It will be 16 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: A 50% reduction in radius means the radius is halved (\\( r_{\\text{new}} = 0.5r_{\\text{original}} \\)). Using Poiseuille's Law:\n  \\[\n  R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{(0.5)^4} = \\frac{1}{0.0625} = 16 \\times R_{\\text{original}}\n  \\]\n  This is consistent with the expected physiological response to a 50% stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This calculation aligns with the principles of fluid dynamics.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- **Strengths**: None. A stenosis of 50% significantly reduces the radius and increases resistance.\n- **Weaknesses**: This option ignores the fundamental relationship between vessel radius and resistance as described by Poiseuille's Law.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale\n\nThe correct answer is **C. It will be 16 times greater**.\n\n- A 50% stenosis reduces the radius of the artery to half its original value. According to Poiseuille's Law, resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Therefore, halving the radius increases resistance by \\( \\frac{1}{(0.5)^4} = 16 \\).\n- This dramatic increase in resistance explains why the stenotic left ICA is the most likely source of emboli causing the patient\u2019s transient ischemic symptoms. \n\nThis reasoning is consistent with both the clinical scenario and the principles of vascular physiology."}

According to **Poiseuille's law**, resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. \n   - This means that small reductions in the radius of the vessel result in exponential increases in resistance.\n\n3. **Interpretation of Doppler Findings**:\n   - The patient has **10% stenosis in the right carotid artery (minimal)** and **50% stenosis in the left carotid artery (moderate)**. The left carotid artery stenosis is the likely culprit for the TIA symptoms, as embolic events often arise from areas of significant stenosis.\n\n4. **Task**:\n   - The question asks for the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery most likely responsible for the symptoms.

The key physiological principle here is **Poiseuille's law**, which describes how resistance to blood flow is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the radius of the vessel. This means that small changes in the radius of a blood vessel result in very large changes in resistance.\n\nKey concepts:\n1. **Arterial stenosis** refers to narrowing of the artery, which reduces the radius.\n2. **Resistance to blood flow** increases dramatically as the radius decreases, following the formula:  \n   \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the vessel.\n3. The patient\u2019s symptoms (right-sided weakness, sensory deficits, and difficulty forming sentences) suggest a transient ischemic attack (TIA), likely due to reduced blood flow from stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (50% stenosis).\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options\n\n#### **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This option assumes a moderate increase in resistance due to stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Poiseuille's law predicts a fourth-power relationship, so a 50% reduction in radius would result in a much larger increase in resistance, not just 4 times.\n\n#### **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: Suggests a larger increase in resistance compared to Option A.\n- **Weaknesses**: Still underestimates the fourth-power relationship. A 50% decrease in radius would result in a much higher increase in resistance.\n\n#### **Option C: It will be 16 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This is consistent with Poiseuille's law, which predicts that reducing the radius by half (50% stenosis) increases resistance by \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\) times.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This matches the physiological principle governing blood flow resistance.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- **Strengths**: None. This contradicts the established relationship between stenosis and resistance.\n- **Weaknesses**: It ignores the fact that arterial narrowing significantly increases resistance, especially in cases of 50% stenosis.\n\n### Selected Option and Rationale\n\n**Correct Answer: C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Poiseuille's law** governs the relationship between radius and resistance. A 50% stenosis means the radius is halved, and resistance increases by \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\) times.\n2. The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIA), which occur due to temporary reductions in blood flow, often caused by significant stenosis of arteries supplying the brain.\n3. The carotid Doppler findings of 50% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery align with the increased resistance causing reduced perfusion, leading to transient neurological symptoms.\n\nBy applying structured reasoning based on physiological principles, **Option C** is the correct choice."}
