The lower extremities are neurologically intact, and anal sensation/tone are preserved. These findings strongly suggest a **central cord syndrome (CCS)**, which is commonly associated with hyperextension injuries of the cervical spine, particularly in older adults with preexisting cervical spondylosis.\n\nThe task asks for the diagnostic modality most likely to confirm the cause of the patient\u2019s neurologic findings. Let\u2019s systematically evaluate each option:\n\n---\n\n### Option A: **CT Angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral or carotid artery dissection, which can occur with trauma to the neck. It provides detailed images of the vasculature.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient's presentation does not suggest a vascular injury (e.g., no symptoms of stroke, Horner syndrome, or vertebrobasilar insufficiency). CT angiography would not provide sufficient detail about spinal cord or soft tissue injuries, which are more likely the cause of his neurologic deficits.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is unlikely to confirm the cause of his neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Option B: **Cervical Myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Cervical myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal and obtaining X-ray or CT images to visualize spinal cord compression or nerve root impingement. It can be helpful in cases where MRI is contraindicated (e.g., metal implants or pacemakers).\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is invasive and largely outdated due to the superior imaging provided by MRI. It is not the first-line modality for diagnosing central cord syndrome or other spinal cord injuries.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is less appropriate given the availability of MRI.\n\n---\n\n### Option C: **X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick and inexpensive and can identify gross bony abnormalities, such as fractures, dislocations, or degenerative changes (e.g., spondylosis). They are often used initially in trauma settings.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays provide limited information about soft tissue structures, including the spinal cord, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. They cannot confirm the cause of neurologic deficits, such as central cord syndrome, which involves spinal cord injury rather than bony pathology.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is inadequate for diagnosing the cause of his neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Option D: **MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries, including central cord syndrome. It provides detailed images of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and ligaments. It can identify spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression due to spondylosis or trauma.\n- **Weaknesses**: MRI may be less accessible in emergency settings compared to CT or X-ray. However, it is the most definitive study for this patient\u2019s presentation.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the best option to confirm the cause of his neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection: **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with **central cord syndrome**, which typically results from hyperextension injuries in older adults with cervical spondylosis. MRI is the imaging modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis, as it provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. It can reveal spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression, which are the hallmarks of this condition. Other options (CT angiography, myelography, and X-ray) are either inappropriate for this clinical scenario or provide insufficient detail to confirm the cause of the neurologic findings.\n\n### Correct Answer: **D**"}

CCS typically affects the upper extremities more than the lower extremities due to the anatomical organization of the corticospinal tracts.\n\nThe goal is to identify the imaging modality that will best confirm the cause of these findings.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options\n\n#### **A. CT Angiography of the Neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries (e.g., vertebral or carotid artery dissection) following trauma. It provides detailed images of blood vessels.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with spinal cord injury, not vascular injury. CT angiography would not provide direct visualization of the spinal cord or soft tissue structures, such as intervertebral discs or ligamentous injuries. It does not confirm the cause of central cord syndrome.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the best choice for this case.\n\n#### **B. Cervical Myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can detect spinal cord compression or abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is invasive, requiring lumbar puncture and contrast injection, and has largely been replaced by MRI for spinal cord imaging due to MRI\u2019s superior resolution and non-invasive nature. It is rarely the first-line imaging modality.\n- **Conclusion**: Outdated and less appropriate than MRI for this case.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the Cervical Spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick and readily available, ideal for detecting fractures or gross cervical spine abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays cannot visualize the spinal cord, soft tissues, or subtle injuries such as ligamentous damage or cord edema. Central cord syndrome is a functional injury of the spinal cord, which X-rays cannot confirm.\n- **Conclusion**: Insufficient for diagnosing central cord syndrome.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the Cervical Spine without Contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed visualization of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and ligaments. MRI can confirm central cord syndrome by showing cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression from disc herniation or ligamentous injury.\n- **Weaknesses**: None relevant in this case. MRI is non-invasive and highly appropriate for this patient.\n- **Conclusion**: The best choice for confirming the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer and Rationale\n\n**Correct Answer: D. MRI of the Cervical Spine without Contrast**\n\nMRI is the optimal imaging modality for evaluating central cord syndrome and other spinal cord injuries. It provides the most detailed and direct visualization of the spinal cord, allowing confirmation of cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression. Given this patient\u2019s clinical presentation, MRI will identify the underlying cause of his neurologic deficits and guide management."}

MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm this diagnosis, as it provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord to detect edema, hemorrhage, or compression that could explain the neurologic deficits.

CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths:** CT angiography (CTA) is excellent for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral or carotid artery dissection, which can occur with cervical trauma. Vascular injury could theoretically contribute to neurologic deficits.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient's neurologic findings are more consistent with spinal cord injury (central cord syndrome) rather than vascular pathology. CTA would not provide detailed information about the spinal cord or the structural changes in the cervical spine (e.g., spondylosis, fractures).\n- **Conclusion:** While useful for vascular evaluation, CTA is not the best modality to confirm the cause of this patient's neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths:** Myelography involves the injection of contrast into the subarachnoid space followed by imaging (usually CT). It can visualize spinal cord compression and other structural abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses:** Myelography is invasive and has largely been replaced by MRI, which provides superior detail of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding structures without the need for contrast injection. It is rarely the first-line diagnostic tool in modern practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Myelography is outdated and less practical compared to MRI for evaluating spinal cord injury.\n\n---\n\n#### **C.
