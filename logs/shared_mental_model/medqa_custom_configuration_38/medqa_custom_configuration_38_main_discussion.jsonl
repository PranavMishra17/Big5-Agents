The hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated, but there is no tenderness, warmth, or erythema. He is afebrile, able to bear weight, and his inflammatory markers (leukocyte count and ESR) are normal. Imaging shows increased fluid in the joint (seen on ultrasound), but no abnormalities on X-ray.\n- **Differential Diagnosis Framework:** Evaluate based on:\n  1. **Acute vs. Chronic Hip Pain:** Acute onset suggests transient conditions or trauma, while chronic conditions are more likely developmental or degenerative.\n  2. **Inflammatory/Infectious vs. Non-inflammatory:** Absence of fever, normal ESR, and leukocyte count argue against infection/inflammation.\n  3. **Imaging Findings:** Increased joint fluid (effusion) on ultrasound supports a transient inflammatory or mechanical process; absence of structural abnormalities on X-ray rules out conditions with bony changes.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **A. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE):**\n- **Strengths:** SCFE typically presents with hip pain and limping, and the hip may assume an externally rotated position.\n- **Weaknesses:** SCFE usually occurs in obese adolescents rather than a healthy 6-year-old child. It is associated with chronic symptoms rather than acute onset. X-rays would typically show displacement of the femoral head, which is absent here.\n- **Conclusion:** SCFE is unlikely in this case due to the patient's age, acute onset, and normal X-ray findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Transient Synovitis:**\n- **Strengths:** Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3\u201310 years. It is often preceded by a viral illness (e.g., upper respiratory infection, as seen here). The clinical presentation (afebrile, ability to bear weight, normal inflammatory markers) and ultrasound findings (joint effusion) strongly support this diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** None significant in this case. The absence of fever and normal labs align with transient synovitis rather than septic arthritis or other inflammatory conditions.\n- **Conclusion:** Transient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical and imaging findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease:**\n- **Strengths:** Legg-Calve-Perthes disease can present with limping and hip pain in children aged 4\u20138 years. It is associated with idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition typically has a more insidious onset rather than acute pain. X-rays would show changes such as femoral head flattening or fragmentation, which are absent here. The presence of joint effusion on ultrasound is less characteristic.\n- **Conclusion:** Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is unlikely due to the acute onset and normal X-ray findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH):**\n- **Strengths:** DDH can cause hip pain and abnormal positioning of the joint.\n- **Weaknesses:** DDH is a congenital condition typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood through screening or imaging. It does not present acutely in a previously healthy 6-year-old child. X-rays would likely show structural abnormalities, which are absent here.\n- **Conclusion:** DDH is not a plausible diagnosis in this case.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection and Rationale:\n**Correct Answer: B. Transient Synovitis**\n\n#### Reasoning:\n1. **Age and Clinical Presentation:** Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3\u201310 years. The acute onset of pain and limping following a recent viral illness (nasal congestion and cough) is classic for this condition.\n2. **Physical Exam:** The child is afebrile, able to bear weight, and has no signs of systemic inflammation (normal leukocyte count and ESR). The hip's slightly abducted and externally rotated position is consistent with transient synovitis.\n3. **Imaging Findings:** Ultrasound shows joint effusion, which is characteristic. The absence of structural abnormalities on X-ray further supports the diagnosis.\n4. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses:** SCFE, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, and DDH are ruled out based on age, clinical course, and imaging findings.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)**\n- **Overview**: DDH is a congenital condition characterized by abnormal development of the hip joint, leading to hip instability or dislocation. It is typically identified in infancy or early childhood.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Hip pain and limping could theoretically occur in untreated cases.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - DDH is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, not at age 6.\n  - The acute onset of symptoms is inconsistent with DDH, which is a chronic condition.\n  - Imaging (X-ray) would typically show abnormalities such as subluxation or dislocation, which are absent here.\n- **Conclusion**: Very unlikely diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer and Rationale:\nThe most likely diagnosis is **B. Transient synovitis**.\n\n- The acute onset of unilateral hip pain and limping in a 6-year-old child, coupled with the history of a recent viral illness, normal inflammatory markers, and the presence of a joint effusion on ultrasound, is classic for transient synovitis.\n- The absence of systemic signs (e.g., fever, elevated ESR) and the ability to bear weight further support this diagnosis.\n- Other conditions (e.g., SCFE, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, DDH) are either inconsistent with the child\u2019s age, clinical presentation, or imaging findings.\n\n**Correct Answer: B.

These clues help narrow down the differential diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)**:\n- **Strengths**: SCFE typically presents with hip pain and limping, and the affected hip may be externally rotated. \n- **Weaknesses**: SCFE is most common in obese adolescents (ages 10\u201316), not a healthy 6-year-old child. Additionally, SCFE is a mechanical issue involving the growth plate and is usually visible on X-ray, which is normal in this case. \n- **Conclusion**: SCFE is unlikely given the patient\u2019s age, normal X-ray, and clinical presentation.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Transient Synovitis**:\n- **Strengths**: Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3\u201310. It often follows a viral illness, which aligns with the boy\u2019s history of nasal congestion and cough 10 days ago. The clinical presentation (limping, slightly externally rotated hip, ability to bear weight, normal inflammatory markers, and increased joint fluid on ultrasound) is classic for transient synovitis. \n- **Weaknesses**: None apparent; this option fits the case very well. \n- **Conclusion**: Transient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease**:\n- **Strengths**: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease can cause hip pain and limping in children aged 4\u201310 and may present with similar symptoms. \n- **Weaknesses**: This condition is a chronic process involving avascular necrosis of the femoral head, not an acute condition. X-rays in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often show abnormalities (e.g., fragmentation or flattening of the femoral head), which are absent in this case. \n- **Conclusion**: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is unlikely given the acute onset and normal X-ray findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)**:\n- **Strengths**: DDH can cause hip abnormalities. \n- **Weaknesses**: DDH is a condition typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, not in a healthy 6-year-old child. There is no history of hip instability or delayed diagnosis, and DDH does not present with acute pain or increased joint fluid. \n- **Conclusion**: DDH is highly unlikely in this case.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**B. Transient Synovitis**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nTransient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis based on:\n1. **Age group**: Most common cause of hip pain in children aged 3\u201310.\n2. **Clinical presentation**: Acute hip pain, limping, slightly externally rotated hip, ability to bear weight, and absence of systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever, elevated inflammatory markers).\n3. **Preceding viral illness**: The boy\u2019s recent history of nasal congestion and mild cough fits the typical prodrome for transient synovitis.\n4. **Imaging findings**: Increased joint fluid on ultrasound supports the diagnosis, while normal X-ray findings rule out other structural abnormalities (e.g., SCFE, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease).\n\nTransient synovitis is a benign, self-limiting condition that usually resolves within 1\u20132 weeks with supportive care (e.g., rest, NSAIDs)."}
