These symptoms are highly suggestive of **intussusception**, a condition where a segment of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction and compromised blood supply. The palpable abdominal mass further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe task is to determine the **next best diagnostic test**, which requires identifying the most appropriate modality to confirm intussusception.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **Option A: Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful for identifying systemic infections, such as sepsis, which can occur in some gastrointestinal emergencies. However, there is no indication in this case of systemic infection (e.g., fever, lethargy, or signs of sepsis).\n- **Weaknesses**: Blood cultures do not provide direct information about the underlying structural or functional issue causing the symptoms (e.g., intussusception). This test is not the most appropriate for diagnosing the suspected condition.\n- **Conclusion**: Peripheral blood culture is not relevant as the next diagnostic test in this context.\n\n#### **Option B: Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: KUB radiographs are often used to evaluate bowel obstruction or perforation. They can show signs of obstruction, such as air-fluid levels or dilated bowel loops.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB radiographs lack sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing intussusception. They cannot reliably visualize the telescoping bowel or confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, are far superior for this purpose.\n- **Conclusion**: KUB radiograph is not the best diagnostic test for intussusception.\n\n#### **Option C: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can help identify anemia (due to blood loss) or signs of infection (e.g., elevated white blood cell count). It could provide supportive data if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.\n- **Weaknesses**: While helpful in assessing overall health, a CBC does not provide direct diagnostic information about intussusception. It is not the primary test for confirming the suspected condition.\n- **Conclusion**: CBC is not the next best diagnostic test for this patient.\n\n#### **Option D: Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Ultrasound is the **gold standard** for diagnosing intussusception. It is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific. The characteristic finding is the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign,\" which represents the telescoped bowel segments. Ultrasound can directly confirm the diagnosis and guide management.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in this context. Ultrasound is the most appropriate test for this clinical scenario.\n- **Conclusion**: Abdominal ultrasound is the next best diagnostic test.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe correct answer is **D. Abdominal ultrasound**.\n\n**Rationale**: The clinical presentation strongly suggests intussusception, a pediatric emergency. Ultrasound is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic modality for this condition. It can confirm the diagnosis, detect complications (e.g., bowel ischemia), and guide treatment decisions, such as air or contrast enema reduction. Other options, while potentially useful in broader contexts, do not provide the direct diagnostic information needed here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D**"}

These findings strongly suggest **intussusception**, a condition in which part of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction and ischemia.\n\nKey diagnostic features:\n- **Bilious vomiting** indicates obstruction distal to the stomach.\n- **Intermittent abdominal pain** is characteristic of intussusception due to periodic telescoping and untelescoping of the bowel.\n- **\"Jelly-like\" stool** (currant jelly stool) is a hallmark of intussusception, caused by sloughed mucosa, blood, and mucus.\n- **Palpable abdominal mass** (\"sausage-shaped\") is often felt in intussusception.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **A. Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful for identifying systemic infections, such as sepsis.\n- **Weaknesses**: This test is not directly diagnostic for intussusception. While intussusception can lead to bowel ischemia and secondary infection, blood culture is not the first-line diagnostic test in this scenario.\n- **Conclusion**: Peripheral blood culture is not the next best test.\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder radiograph (KUB)**\n- **Strengths**: A KUB radiograph can show signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops of bowel, and may reveal a \"target sign\" or \"crescent sign\" in some cases of intussusception.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB has lower sensitivity and specificity for intussusception compared to ultrasound. It is not the preferred diagnostic modality in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: KUB is not the optimal next step.\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can provide information about anemia (due to blood loss), infection (elevated white blood cell count), or dehydration (hemoconcentration).\n- **Weaknesses**: While useful for evaluating secondary effects of intussusception, a CBC does not directly diagnose the condition. It is not the next best test for confirming intussusception.\n- **Conclusion**: CBC is not the next best diagnostic test.\n\n#### **D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Abdominal ultrasound is the **gold standard** for diagnosing intussusception. It is non-invasive, widely available, and highly sensitive and specific for detecting the characteristic findings of intussusception, such as the **\"target sign\"** (concentric rings) and **\"pseudokidney sign\"** (overlapping bowel loops).\n- **Weaknesses**: None relevant in this context. Ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic modality.\n- **Conclusion**: Abdominal ultrasound is the correct next test for this patient.\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Rationale:\nAbdominal ultrasound is the best diagnostic test for intussusception because it is highly sensitive and specific for the condition, non-invasive, and can provide real-time imaging of the telescoped bowel segments. This test would confirm the diagnosis and guide further management, such as air or contrast enema reduction or surgical intervention if necessary. Other tests (blood culture, CBC, or KUB radiograph) are either less specific or not directly diagnostic for intussusception."}

Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures are useful for detecting systemic infections, especially in febrile patients or those suspected of sepsis.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s presentation is more consistent with a gastrointestinal obstruction (intussusception) rather than systemic infection. Blood culture would not directly confirm the diagnosis of intussusception, making it inappropriate as the next best diagnostic test.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the correct choice.\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder radiograph (KUB)**\n- **Strengths**: A plain abdominal X-ray can identify signs of bowel obstruction, free air (if perforation is suspected), or other abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: While KUB may show nonspecific signs of obstruction, it is not sensitive or specific for diagnosing intussusception. It would not reliably show the telescoping bowel segments characteristic of intussusception.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the correct choice.\n\n#### **C.
