This requires an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of local anesthetics, specifically their **duration of action**, which is influenced by factors such as lipid solubility, protein binding, and metabolism.\n\nKey concepts:\n1. **Local anesthetics** can be divided into two classes: **esters** (e.g., chloroprocaine) and **amides** (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, and etidocaine).\n2. **Esters** are typically metabolized more quickly by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations of action compared to most **amides**, which are metabolized more slowly in the liver.\n3. Among the amides, lipid solubility and protein binding influence the duration of action: higher lipid solubility and protein binding are associated with longer durations.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n#### **A. Mepivacaine**\n- **Class:** Amide\n- **Duration of action:** Intermediate (approximately 90\u2013180 minutes when used for infiltration).\n- **Strengths:** Longer duration than chloroprocaine but shorter than etidocaine. Commonly used in clinical practice.\n- **Weaknesses:** Not the shortest-acting anesthetic in this list.\n\n#### **B. Chloroprocaine**\n- **Class:** Ester\n- **Duration of action:** Shortest among the listed options (approximately 30\u201360 minutes when used for infiltration).\n- **Strengths:** Very rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases, leading to a short duration of action.\n- **Weaknesses:** Short duration may be a limitation in some procedures, but it is ideal for this case where short-acting anesthesia is desired.\n\n#### **C. Lidocaine**\n- **Class:** Amide\n- **Duration of action:** Intermediate (approximately 90\u2013120 minutes when used for infiltration).\n- **Strengths:** Commonly used due to its safety profile and intermediate duration of action.\n- **Weaknesses:** Longer duration of action compared to chloroprocaine, making it less suitable for this question.\n\n#### **D. Etidocaine**\n- **Class:** Amide\n- **Duration of action:** Long (up to 240\u2013360 minutes when used for infiltration).\n- **Strengths:** Provides prolonged analgesia when needed.\n- **Weaknesses:** Significantly longer duration than required in this case, making it the least suitable option.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n- **Esters vs. Amides:** Esters (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized more rapidly than amides, resulting in shorter durations of action.\n- **Clinical Context:** The patient is undergoing incision and drainage of an abscess, a relatively quick procedure, so a short-acting anesthetic is appropriate.\n\n### Selection of the Correct Option:\nThe local anesthetic with the **shortest duration of analgesia** is **chloroprocaine**, an ester anesthetic that is rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterases.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n### Rationale:\nChloroprocaine, as an ester, has the shortest duration of action among the listed options (approximately 30\u201360 minutes). This makes it the most appropriate choice for a quick procedure like incision and drainage of an abscess, where prolonged anesthesia is unnecessary."}

The question specifies that the drug is administered via **subcutaneous infiltration** and is used for incision and drainage of an abscess. Local anesthetics vary in their **onset of action, potency, and duration**, which depend on their chemical composition (amide vs. ester), lipid solubility, protein binding, and metabolism.\n\nKey factors to consider:\n1. **Classification of Local Anesthetics**: \n   - **Amides**: Metabolized by the liver (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine).\n   - **Esters**: Metabolized by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations of action (e.g., chloroprocaine).\n   \n2. **Duration of Action**:\n   - Esters generally have a shorter duration compared to amides.\n   - Among amides, the duration varies based on protein binding and lipid solubility.\n\n3. **Clinical Context**: The goal is to provide a **short-acting** anesthetic for a minor procedure (incision and drainage).\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **A.

Etidocaine**\n- **Type**: Amide local anesthetic.\n- **Duration**: Long-acting (4\u20138 hours when used for infiltration).\n- **Strengths**: Provides prolonged analgesia.\n- **Weaknesses**: Duration is far longer than required for this procedure, making it unsuitable for the goal of short-acting analgesia.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Principles:\n\nGiven the clinical scenario, the ideal choice is a **short-acting local anesthetic**. Based on the pharmacokinetics of the options:\n- **Chloroprocaine (Option B)** is the shortest-acting anesthetic due to its classification as an ester and its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases.\n- Mepivacaine (A), Lidocaine (C), and Etidocaine (D) are all amides, with progressively longer durations of action.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n### Rationale:\nChloroprocaine is an ester anesthetic with the shortest duration of action (30\u201360 minutes). It is rapidly metabolized, making it ideal for a minor procedure like incision and drainage of an abscess. The other options (mepivacaine, lidocaine, and etidocaine) are amides with longer durations of action, which are unnecessary for this clinical context."}

Chloroprocaine**. This conclusion is based on its classification as an ester anesthetic, its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases, and its well-documented short duration of action (30\u201360 minutes).
