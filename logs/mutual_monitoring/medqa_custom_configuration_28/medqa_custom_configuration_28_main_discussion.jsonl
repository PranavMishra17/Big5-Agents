Local anesthetics differ in their onset and duration of action based on their chemical properties, including lipid solubility, protein binding, and metabolism. The drug classes involved are **amides** (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine) and **esters** (e.g., chloroprocaine). Esters typically have shorter durations of action than amides due to their rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases.\n\n#### Systematic Evaluation of Each Option:\n\n**A. Mepivacaine**  \n- **Type**: Amide  \n- **Duration**: Intermediate (longer than chloroprocaine but shorter than etidocaine).  \n- **Use**: Commonly used for regional anesthesia and has a moderate duration of action.  \n- **Weakness**: Not the shortest-acting anesthetic; duration of action is longer than chloroprocaine and lidocaine.\n\n**B. Chloroprocaine**  \n- **Type**: Ester  \n- **Duration**: Very short due to rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases.  \n- **Use**: Often used for procedures requiring very short anesthesia.  \n- **Strength**: Known for having the shortest duration of action among commonly used local anesthetics.  \n\n**C. Lidocaine**  \n- **Type**: Amide  \n- **Duration**: Short to intermediate (longer than chloroprocaine but shorter than mepivacaine and etidocaine).  \n- **Use**: Widely used in emergency procedures; faster onset than chloroprocaine but longer duration of action.  \n- **Weakness**: Short-acting but not as short as chloroprocaine.\n\n**D. Etidocaine**  \n- **Type**: Amide  \n- **Duration**: Long due to high lipid solubility and protein binding.  \n- **Use**: Used for prolonged procedures requiring extended anesthesia.  \n- **Weakness**: Clearly not the shortest-acting anesthetic; duration is significantly longer than other options.\n\n#### Relevant Principles:\n- **Chemical Class**: Esters (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized faster than amides (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine), leading to shorter duration of action.  \n- **Clinical Application**: For quick procedures such as incision and drainage, a short-acting anesthetic like chloroprocaine is preferred to minimize residual effects.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe shortest duration of analgesia is provided by **chloroprocaine**, an ester-type local anesthetic.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n### Rationale:\nChloroprocaine is an ester-type anesthetic that is rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterases, resulting in the shortest duration of action among the listed options. This makes it ideal for procedures requiring brief anesthesia, such as incision and drainage of an abscess."}

Local anesthetics are classified into **amides** (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine) and **esters** (e.g., chloroprocaine). Their duration of action depends on factors such as their chemical structure, metabolism, and protein binding. Ester-type anesthetics are generally metabolized more rapidly by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations of action compared to amide-type anesthetics.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### A. Mepivacaine\n- **Class**: Amide local anesthetic.\n- **Duration**: Intermediate duration of action (approximately 90\u2013180 minutes for infiltration).\n- **Metabolism**: Metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Provides longer analgesia compared to short-acting agents like chloroprocaine. Not the shortest-acting option.\n\n#### B. Chloroprocaine\n- **Class**: Ester local anesthetic.\n- **Duration**: Very short duration of action (approximately 30\u201360 minutes for infiltration).\n- **Metabolism**: Rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterases.\n- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Known for its rapid onset and short duration, making it the shortest-acting local anesthetic among the options.\n\n#### C. Lidocaine\n- **Class**: Amide local anesthetic.\n- **Duration**: Intermediate duration of action (approximately 60\u2013120 minutes for infiltration).\n- **Metabolism**: Metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Commonly used due to its safety profile and versatility, but its duration of action is longer than chloroprocaine.\n\n#### D. Etidocaine\n- **Class**: Amide local anesthetic.\n- **Duration**: Long duration of action (approximately 180\u2013600 minutes for infiltration).\n- **Metabolism**: Metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Provides prolonged analgesia, making it unsuitable for cases requiring short-term analgesia.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\n1. **Chemical Structure**: Ester-type anesthetics (e.g., chloroprocaine) are hydrolyzed faster than amide-type anesthetics, leading to shorter durations of action.\n2. **Clinical Context**: The patient requires a **short-acting local anesthetic** for a minor procedure (incision and drainage of an abscess). Chloroprocaine is ideal in this scenario due to its short duration of action and rapid metabolism.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n#### Rationale:\nChloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic with the shortest duration of action among the options provided. It is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterases, leading to a duration of analgesia of approximately 30\u201360 minutes, making it well-suited for short procedures like incision and drainage of an abscess. Other options (mepivacaine, lidocaine, etidocaine) have longer durations of action and are therefore less appropriate for this clinical scenario."}
