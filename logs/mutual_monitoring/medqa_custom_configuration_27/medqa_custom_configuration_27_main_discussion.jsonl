ARR is calculated as the difference in the **risk** (proportion of individuals contracting RSV) between the standard of care group and the new vaccine group.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Risk in Each Group\n1. **Risk in the New Vaccine Group**:\n   - Total individuals in the group: 520\n   - Individuals contracting RSV: 13\n   - Risk = \\( \\frac{13}{520} \\)\n   - Risk = \\( 0.025 \\) or **2.5%**\n\n2. **Risk in the Standard of Care Group**:\n   - Total individuals in the group: 480\n   - Individuals contracting RSV: 30\n   - Risk = \\( \\frac{30}{480} \\)\n   - Risk = \\( 0.0625 \\) or **6.25%**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)\nARR is calculated as:\n\\[\nARR = \\text{Risk in Standard of Care Group} - \\text{Risk in New Vaccine Group}\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nARR = 6.25\\% - 2.5\\%\n\\]\n\\[\nARR = 3.75\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nThe calculated ARR is **3.75%**, which corresponds to **Option C**. Let\u2019s analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A (1.7%)**: This value is too low and does not match the calculated ARR.\n- **Option B (2.5%)**: This value represents the risk in the new vaccine group, not the ARR. It is incorrect.\n- **Option C (3.75%)**: This matches the calculated ARR, making it the correct answer.\n- **Option D (4.3%)**: This value is higher than the calculated ARR and is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C. 3.75%**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in risk between the standard of care group and the new vaccine group. After performing the calculations, the ARR is 3.75%, which is most consistent with Option C."}
