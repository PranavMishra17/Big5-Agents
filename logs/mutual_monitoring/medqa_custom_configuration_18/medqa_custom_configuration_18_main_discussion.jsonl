His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show the following:\n\n- **Blood pH:** 7.52 (alkalosis)\n- **PaO2:** 74 mm Hg (hypoxemia)\n- **PaCO2:** 28 mm Hg (low, indicating hyperventilation)\n- **HCO3-:** 21 mEq/L (slightly decreased but not enough to indicate primary metabolic disturbance)\n\nThe patient has a primary alkalotic state, as evidenced by the elevated pH. Now, let\u2019s evaluate each option systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect because the patient\u2019s blood pH is elevated (7.52), indicating alkalosis. Additionally, PaCO2 is decreased, and HCO3- is slightly reduced, further confirming an acid-base disturbance. Normal acid-base status would require a pH within the normal range (7.35\u20137.45), which is not the case here.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Analysis:** Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low blood pH (<7.35) and a primary decrease in HCO3-. This patient has an elevated pH (alkalosis), not a decreased pH, and the HCO3- is only mildly reduced, likely due to compensation. Thus, this is not a metabolic acidosis.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Analysis:** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by low pH (<7.35) and elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg), typically caused by hypoventilation. In this patient, the pH is elevated (alkalosis), and PaCO2 is decreased (28 mm Hg), indicating hyperventilation rather than hypoventilation. This does not fit respiratory acidosis.\n- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Analysis:** Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by elevated pH (>7.45) and decreased PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg), typically due to hyperventilation. This patient\u2019s ABG findings (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg) are consistent with respiratory alkalosis. The slight reduction in HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is likely a compensatory response to the primary respiratory disturbance. The clinical context of pneumonia with associated hypoxemia likely triggered hyperventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Selection and Rationale**\nThe correct answer is **D. Respiratory alkalosis**.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the following:\n1. **Primary disturbance:** Elevated pH (7.52) and decreased PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) indicate a primary respiratory alkalosis.\n2. **Compensation:** Mild reduction in HCO3- (21 mEq/L) suggests renal compensation, which is expected in respiratory alkalosis.\n3. **Clinical context:** The patient\u2019s pneumonia and hypoxemia likely caused hyperventilation, driving the respiratory alkalosis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**"}

The ABG results provide critical information about his acid-base status:\n\n- **Blood pH:** 7.52 (alkalosis)\n- **PaO2:** 74 mm Hg (hypoxemia)\n- **PaCO2:** 28 mm Hg (low, indicating hyperventilation)\n- **HCO3-:** 21 mEq/L (slightly low but not in the range of metabolic acidosis)\n\nThe elevated pH confirms that the patient is in an alkalotic state. To determine the primary acid-base disturbance, we need to analyze the PaCO2 and HCO3- values. A low PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg) is consistent with **respiratory alkalosis**, as it indicates excessive elimination of CO2 through hyperventilation.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options\n\n#### **Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths:** None, as the ABG clearly demonstrates alkalosis (pH >7.45).\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient's pH is elevated, indicating an acid-base disturbance. Both PaCO2 and HCO3- are abnormal, ruling out normal status.\n\n#### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** A low HCO3- could suggest metabolic acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** The pH is elevated, which is inconsistent with acidosis. In metabolic acidosis, the pH would typically be low (<7.35). Additionally, the primary disturbance is respiratory (low PaCO2), not metabolic.\n\n#### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** None, as the ABG does not demonstrate respiratory acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** Respiratory acidosis would require an elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg) and a low pH (<7.35). This patient's PaCO2 is low, and the pH is high, ruling out respiratory acidosis.\n\n#### **Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths:** The elevated pH and low PaCO2 strongly support respiratory alkalosis. Hyperventilation due to hypoxemia (PaO2 of 74 mm Hg) is a common cause of respiratory alkalosis, especially in patients with pneumonia or sepsis.\n- **Weaknesses:** The slightly low HCO3- (21 mEq/L) might suggest a compensatory metabolic process. However, this does not change the primary diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis.\n\n### Relevant Principles\n1. **Primary Acid-Base Disturbance:** The direction of change in pH and PaCO2 indicates whether the disturbance is respiratory or metabolic. In this case, the low PaCO2 and elevated pH confirm respiratory alkalosis.\n2. **Compensation:** The slightly low HCO3- is likely a compensatory response to the alkalosis, as the kidneys attempt to restore acid-base balance.\n3. **Clinical Context:** Pneumonia and hypoxemia are common triggers of hyperventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis.\n\n### Correct Answer: **D. Respiratory alkalosis**\nThis patient\u2019s elevated pH (alkalosis), low PaCO2, and clinical presentation (pneumonia with hypoxemia) are consistent with respiratory alkalosis. The slightly low HCO3- is a compensatory mechanism and does not alter the primary diagnosis."}

If the pH were low and HCO3- were significantly decreased, this could be a plausible option.\n- **Weaknesses:** The pH is elevated, not decreased, ruling out acidosis. Additionally, while HCO3- is slightly decreased, this is likely compensatory rather than the primary disturbance.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**C. Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH and elevated PaCO2. If PaCO2 were increased and pH were decreased, this could be a plausible option.\n- **Weaknesses:** The pH is elevated, not decreased, and PaCO2 is decreased rather than elevated, ruling out respiratory acidosis.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**D.

This option aligns perfectly with the patient\u2019s ABG results.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is correct.\n\n### **Final Selection:**\n**D.

The patient\u2019s ABG clearly shows an alkalotic pH (7.52), which is outside the normal range (7.35\u20137.45).\n- **Weaknesses**: This option does not account for the abnormal findings in pH, PaCO2, and HCO3-. The patient is not in a normal acid-base state.\n\n#### **Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Metabolic acidosis is often seen in sepsis due to lactic acid production. However, this is not supported by the current ABG.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH is alkalotic, not acidotic. The HCO3- is mildly decreased but not enough to indicate primary metabolic acidosis. The primary disturbance here is respiratory, not metabolic.\n\n#### **Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory acidosis could occur in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypoventilation. This patient has a smoking history, but no evidence of hypoventilation or elevated PaCO2.\n- **Weaknesses**: The ABG shows a decreased PaCO2 (28 mm Hg), which is the opposite of what would be seen in respiratory acidosis (elevated PaCO2).
