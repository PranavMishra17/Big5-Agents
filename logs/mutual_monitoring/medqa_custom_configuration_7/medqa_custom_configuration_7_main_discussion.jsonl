However, it is typically reserved for cases where there is a high suspicion of metastasis based on clinical findings (e.g., bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, or advanced disease).\n- **Weaknesses**: In this case, there is no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient has no symptoms suggestive of bone involvement, and the mass has not yet been confirmed as malignant. Performing a bone scan at this stage would be premature and unnecessary.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the appropriate next step.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option B: Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133**\n- **Strengths**: CA 15\u20133 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in breast cancer, particularly in cases of metastatic or recurrent disease. It is sometimes used for monitoring treatment response or disease progression.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tumor markers like CA 15\u20133 are not useful for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. They lack sensitivity and specificity for early detection, and their measurement would not provide actionable information at this stage.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the appropriate next step.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option C: Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths**: Mastectomy is a definitive surgical treatment for breast cancer. It is indicated in cases where malignancy has been confirmed and surgical intervention is deemed necessary.\n- **Weaknesses**: Mastectomy is not appropriate as an initial step before confirming the diagnosis. The patient\u2019s mass has not yet been biopsied or histologically characterized, so proceeding directly to surgery would be premature and inappropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the appropriate next step.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option D: Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths**: Core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a tissue sample to confirm the diagnosis of a suspicious breast mass. It allows for histopathological evaluation, which is essential to determine whether the mass is malignant, benign, or another type of lesion. This is the most logical next step after identifying a suspicious mass on mammography.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in this scenario. Core needle biopsy is minimally invasive, highly accurate, and provides critical information for further management.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most appropriate next step.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **D. Core needle biopsy**\n\n#### **Rationale**:\nThe patient presents with a suspicious breast mass identified on mammography. While her clinical examination does not show signs of advanced disease (e.g., skin changes, nipple retraction, palpable axillary adenopathy), the presence of a firm, nontender mass warrants further investigation. The most appropriate next step is to perform a core needle biopsy to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. This will confirm whether the mass is malignant and guide subsequent management decisions, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or other interventions.\n\nPerforming other tests (e.g., bone scan or tumor marker measurement) or proceeding directly to surgery without confirming the diagnosis would be inappropriate and premature. Core needle biopsy is the standard of care in this situation."}

The clinical scenario suggests a need for further evaluation of the breast lesion to confirm the diagnosis and determine next steps.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **A. Bone scan**\n- **Strengths**: Bone scans are used to detect metastatic disease, particularly in patients with known breast cancer who are symptomatic (e.g., bone pain) or have advanced disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient does not have a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer yet, nor does she have symptoms suggesting bone metastases. Performing a bone scan at this stage would be premature and inappropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the correct next step.\n\n#### **B. Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133**\n- **Strengths**: Serum CA 15\u20133 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in breast cancer, particularly in metastatic disease. It is sometimes used for monitoring treatment response or recurrence.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tumor markers like CA 15\u20133 are not used for initial diagnosis of breast cancer or evaluation of a suspicious breast mass. They are typically utilized after a diagnosis has been established and are not sensitive or specific enough for initial workup.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the correct next step.\n\n#### **C. Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths**: Mastectomy is a treatment option for breast cancer, particularly in cases where breast-conserving surgery is not feasible or the patient prefers this approach.\n- **Weaknesses**: Mastectomy is not appropriate as the next step because the patient does not have a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer. Surgical intervention should only follow histological confirmation of malignancy.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the correct next step.\n\n#### **D. Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths**: Core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining tissue samples from a suspicious breast mass. It allows for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. It is minimally invasive and provides definitive information about the nature of the lesion.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in this scenario. It is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the correct next step.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n- The evaluation of a suspicious breast mass begins with imaging (e.g., mammography, ultrasound) followed by tissue sampling to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging alone cannot differentiate benign from malignant lesions with certainty.\n- Core needle biopsy is preferred over fine-needle aspiration because it provides a larger tissue sample, allowing for more accurate histological analysis, including assessment of tumor grade and receptor status if cancer is confirmed.\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. Core needle biopsy**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient has a suspicious breast mass identified on mammography, and clinical examination supports the need for further evaluation. Core needle biopsy is the most appropriate next step because it provides definitive histological diagnosis, which is essential for planning treatment. Other options, such as bone scans or tumor marker measurement, are premature at this stage, and surgical intervention should only follow confirmation of malignancy."}

Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133**\n- **Strengths**: Serum CA 15\u20133 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in advanced breast cancer and is sometimes used for monitoring disease progression or recurrence.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tumor markers like CA 15\u20133 are not used in the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. They are primarily used for monitoring known metastatic or recurrent disease. In this case, the patient has a suspicious breast mass that requires tissue diagnosis, not serum marker evaluation.\n\n#### **C. Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths**: Mastectomy is a definitive treatment option for breast cancer, particularly in cases of large tumors or patient preference. It may also be used prophylactically in high-risk individuals.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer yet. Performing a mastectomy without first obtaining a tissue diagnosis would be inappropriate and overly aggressive. The next step should focus on confirming the diagnosis, not proceeding directly to treatment.\n\n#### **D. Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths**: Core needle biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating suspicious breast masses. It allows for histopathological examination and confirmation of the diagnosis (e.g., invasive carcinoma, benign lesion, etc.).\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This is the most appropriate next step as it directly addresses the need for tissue diagnosis before proceeding to treatment planning.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe most appropriate next step in management is **D. Core needle biopsy**.\n\n#### **Rationale**:\n- The patient has a suspicious breast mass identified both clinically and on mammography.
