Peripheral blood culture**\n- **Strengths**: Blood cultures may be useful in cases of suspected sepsis or systemic infection, which could present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and other nonspecific symptoms.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no evidence in this case to suggest systemic infection (e.g., fever, hemodynamic instability). The primary concern here is gastrointestinal obstruction, not an infectious process. Blood cultures would not provide diagnostic information relevant to intussusception.\n- **Conclusion**: This test is not appropriate as the next step.\n\n#### **B. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: A KUB radiograph can identify signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels. It is a quick and readily available imaging modality.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB radiographs are nonspecific and less sensitive for detecting intussusception. They may show indirect signs (e.g., bowel obstruction or soft tissue mass), but they cannot confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, are preferred for intussusception.\n- **Conclusion**: While KUB might provide some information, it is not the best diagnostic test in this scenario.\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can help assess for anemia (e.g., from blood loss) or leukocytosis (e.g., from infection or inflammation). It may provide supportive information about the patient\u2019s overall condition.\n- **Weaknesses**: A CBC does not provide specific diagnostic information for intussusception. While it may identify secondary findings (e.g., anemia), it does not confirm or rule out the condition. Imaging is required to establish the diagnosis.\n- **Conclusion**: This test may be helpful later in the workup but is not the next best diagnostic test.\n\n#### **D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Abdominal ultrasound is the **gold standard** for diagnosing intussusception. It is noninvasive, highly sensitive, and specific. The characteristic finding is the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign,\" which represents the telescoped bowel segments.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context. Ultrasound is widely available and does not expose the patient to radiation.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most appropriate next diagnostic test for this patient.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation strongly suggests intussusception, and abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing this condition. It is a noninvasive, highly effective imaging modality that can confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent management, which may include air or contrast enema reduction. The other options (A, B, and C) do not provide specific diagnostic information for intussusception and are not appropriate as the next step in this scenario."}

Kidney, ureter, bladder radiograph (KUB)**\n- **Strengths**: KUB radiographs can identify bowel obstruction or perforation. In intussusception, findings such as a \"target sign\" or \"crescent sign\" may occasionally be seen.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB radiographs are less sensitive and specific for intussusception compared to other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound. They may miss the diagnosis entirely.\n- **Conclusion**: This is not the most appropriate diagnostic test for intussusception in this case.\n\n#### **C. Complete blood count with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can provide information about infection (e.g., leukocytosis) or anemia (e.g., blood loss).\n- **Weaknesses**: While a CBC may offer supportive information, it does not directly diagnose intussusception.

It is non-invasive, widely available, and provides detailed imaging of the bowel, allowing visualization of the characteristic signs of intussusception. Early diagnosis is critical to prevent complications such as bowel necrosis, perforation, or sepsis, and ultrasound is the fastest and most reliable way to achieve this."}

They can identify bacteremia, which is relevant if there is concern for infectious complications.\n- **Weaknesses**: This test does not directly address the root cause of the patient's symptoms (abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and bloody stools). While sepsis can complicate intussusception, there is no evidence in this vignette suggesting systemic infection (e.g., fever, hemodynamic instability). Hence, this is not the next best diagnostic test.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate for this situation.\n\n#### **Option B: Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) radiograph**\n- **Strengths**: A KUB radiograph can sometimes identify signs of intestinal obstruction (e.g., air-fluid levels, dilated bowel loops) or a soft-tissue mass.\n- **Weaknesses**: KUB has limited sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing intussusception. It may miss the classic findings of intussusception, such as the \"target sign\" or \"doughnut sign,\" which are better visualized with ultrasound. A KUB is not the most definitive or efficient test in this scenario.\n- **Conclusion**: Suboptimal choice for this presentation.\n\n#### **Option C: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**\n- **Strengths**: A CBC can provide information about anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytopenia, which may be relevant if there is significant blood loss or infection.\n- **Weaknesses**: Similar to blood cultures, a CBC does not directly diagnose intussusception. While it may provide supportive information, it is not the next best diagnostic test for this acute presentation.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the best choice in this scenario.\n\n#### **Option D: Abdominal ultrasound**\n- **Strengths**: Ultrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice for intussusception. It is non-invasive, widely available, and highly sensitive and specific. Classic findings on ultrasound include the \"target sign\" or \"doughnut sign\" (cross-sectional view) and the \"pseudo-kidney sign\" (longitudinal view), which confirm the diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in this context.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of intussusception.\n\n---\n\n### Selected Option: **D.

Abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing intussusception, offering high sensitivity and specificity. It can confirm the presence of the intussusception and guide subsequent management, such as air or contrast enema reduction.\n\nOther options, such as blood cultures (A), KUB radiographs (B), and CBC (C), may provide ancillary information but do not directly diagnose intussusception or guide immediate management.
