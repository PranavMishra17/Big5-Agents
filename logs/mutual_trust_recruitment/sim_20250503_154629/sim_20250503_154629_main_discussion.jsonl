Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **Option A: Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a common form of autoimmune encephalitis and often presents with psychiatric symptoms, memory impairment, seizures, and dyskinesias. It can also involve CSF pleocytosis and EEG abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses:** The MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are not typical in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Instead, MRI is often normal or nonspecific in these cases. Additionally, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is more commonly associated with ovarian teratomas and younger patients, particularly females in their teens or twenties.\n\n#### **Option B: Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with limbic encephalitis, which presents with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. MRI frequently shows hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobes, as seen in this patient. CSF findings often include mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and EEG abnormalities such as focal slowing in the temporal regions are consistent with this diagnosis. It is also more common in middle-aged adults, aligning with this patient's age.\n- **Weaknesses:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is less likely to present with systemic or extra-neurological features compared to some other autoimmune encephalitides, but this does not weaken its relevance here.\n\n#### **Option C: Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis, including memory impairment, confusion, and seizures. MRI may show medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, and CSF pleocytosis is also common.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition is more commonly associated with underlying small-cell lung cancer (paraneoplastic syndrome), which is less likely in a 32-year-old without other systemic symptoms or risk factors for malignancy.\n\n#### **Option D: Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can also present with limbic encephalitis, including memory deficits and behavioral changes. MRI findings and CSF pleocytosis are possible.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition is typically seen in older patients and is frequently associated with an underlying malignancy, such as breast or lung cancer. It is less common than anti-LGI1 encephalitis and less likely in this clinical context.\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Answer: B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n#### **Reasoning:**\n1. **Clinical Presentation:** The patient\u2019s subacute onset of memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes over 3 weeks is classic for limbic encephalitis.\n2. **MRI Findings:** Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are highly characteristic of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n3. **CSF and EEG Findings:** Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and focal slowing in the temporal regions further support a diagnosis of limbic encephalitis, which is strongly associated with anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n4. **Demographics:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is more common in middle-aged adults, and this patient\u2019s age (32 years) fits the profile better than other options, particularly anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor encephalitides, which are more often seen in older adults and/or associated with malignancies.\n\nThus, **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies** is the most likely autoantibody associated with this patient\u2019s presentation."}

However, it is often associated with ovarian teratomas in young women and may involve a broader range of symptoms beyond the limbic system. MRI findings are often normal or show nonspecific changes, and CSF usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with oligoclonal bands.\n- **Weaknesses**: While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can involve memory and behavioral changes, the hallmark limbic system involvement (bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities) is less common compared to other antibodies. This makes it a less likely candidate in this specific case.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely given the predominant limbic involvement described here.\n\n---\n\n### Option B: **Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with **limbic encephalitis**, which classically presents with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes.

It is strongly associated with underlying small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is a key clue in its diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient's age (32 years) and lack of any mention of an underlying malignancy make anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis less likely.

This conclusion aligns with the analyses provided by teammates across different specialties."}
