It can also involve the medial temporal lobes, though MRI findings are often normal or nonspecific in these cases. CSF often shows lymphocytic pleocytosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a possibility, the presence of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI is less characteristic of this condition. This imaging finding is more typical of other subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n#### **Option B: Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-LGI1-associated encephalitis is strongly associated with bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI, which is a hallmark of the condition. It frequently presents with memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes, as seen in this patient. Focal slowing on EEG in the temporal regions is also consistent with this diagnosis. CSF findings are often mild, with lymphocytic pleocytosis being a common feature.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this clinical context. This option aligns well with the patient's presentation.\n\n#### **Option C: Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis often presents with seizures as a prominent feature, along with confusion and behavioral changes. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe involvement. CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis is also common.\n- **Weaknesses**: While medial temporal lobe hyperintensities can occur, the clinical presentation of this condition is more commonly dominated by seizures rather than the cognitive and behavioral symptoms seen in this patient. This makes it a less likely option in this specific case.\n\n#### **Option D: Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with psychiatric symptoms, confusion, and memory deficits. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe involvement, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis can be present.\n- **Weaknesses**: This condition is less common and often occurs in older individuals or in association with malignancies. The patient's age and lack of malignancy-related features make this a less likely diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### **Selection and Rationale**\nThe most likely diagnosis in this case is **anti-LGI1 antibody-associated encephalitis** (Option B). This is supported by:\n1. **MRI findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are a hallmark of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n2. **Clinical presentation**: Subacute onset of memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes are classic features of this condition.\n3. **CSF findings**: Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis is consistent with autoimmune encephalitis.\n4. **EEG findings**: Focal slowing in the temporal regions aligns with the involvement of the medial temporal lobes.\n\nWhile other options (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor or anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies) are possible, they are less likely given the specific imaging findings and clinical presentation.\n\n### **Final Answer**: **B.

It is more frequent in younger individuals, particularly females.\n- **Weaknesses:** While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can involve the medial temporal lobes, the hallmark MRI finding is often normal or shows nonspecific changes, rather than isolated bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. Additionally, the EEG in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically shows diffuse slowing rather than focal slowing in the temporal regions.\n\n#### B. **Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis classically presents with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes, which align with this case. MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities (limbic encephalitis) are a hallmark of this condition. Focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF are also consistent with this diagnosis. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged adults and has a strong association with these clinical features.\n- **Weaknesses:** None significant in this context; the clinical and radiologic findings strongly support this diagnosis.\n\n#### C. **Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can also present with limbic encephalitis, including memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. MRI findings may include bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition is more commonly associated with seizures as a prominent feature, which is not described in this case. It is also more frequently associated with an underlying malignancy (e.g., small-cell lung cancer), which is not mentioned here.\n\n#### D. **Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis, including memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. MRI findings may include medial temporal lobe hyperintensities.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition is less common than anti-LGI1 encephalitis and is often associated with malignancies, particularly in older individuals. The clinical presentation and demographics in this case are less typical for anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis.\n\n---\n\n### Rationale for Selecting B. Anti-LGI1 Antibodies:\nThe patient's presentation of subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes, combined with MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, and EEG showing focal slowing in the temporal regions, is highly suggestive of **limbic encephalitis**. Among the listed options, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most likely cause of this condition, particularly given the patient's age and the specific radiologic and electroencephalographic findings.
