These findings strongly suggest **limbic encephalitis**, a condition often associated with autoimmune processes and specific autoantibodies.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, memory deficits, seizures, and autonomic instability. It is more common in younger individuals and often associated with ovarian teratomas. However, bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are less specific for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and may not be the predominant finding.\n- **Weaknesses:** The clinical presentation here lacks the hallmark features of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, such as prominent psychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation, hallucinations), dyskinesias, or autonomic dysfunction. MRI findings are not as characteristic for this antibody.\n\n#### **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a classic cause of limbic encephalitis, presenting with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are highly characteristic. Patients may also exhibit faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), which are a hallmark feature. CSF findings of mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and EEG abnormalities (focal slowing in the temporal regions) are consistent with this diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** The absence of mention of FBDS in this case slightly weakens the association, but FBDS is not universally present.\n\n#### **C. Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and confusion. It is often associated with seizures and may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome, particularly with small-cell lung cancer.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient's presentation lacks the hallmark seizure activity and paraneoplastic context commonly seen in anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis. MRI findings are less specific for this antibody.\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including confusion and memory deficits. It is often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly breast and lung cancers.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient's presentation lacks the paraneoplastic context and systemic findings often seen with anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis. MRI findings are not specific for this antibody.\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation of **subacute memory deficits, confusion, behavioral changes**, and **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** is most consistent with **anti-LGI1 antibody-associated encephalitis**, a classic cause of limbic encephalitis. The CSF findings of mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and EEG abnormalities further support this diagnosis. While faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) are a hallmark feature of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, their absence does not rule out the condition.\n\n### Correct Answer: **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**"}

It is a common autoimmune encephalitis in young adults, particularly women.\n- **Weaknesses:** The MRI findings in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are often normal or nonspecific. Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities (as seen in this case) are less characteristic. Additionally, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis often involves more prominent psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, agitation) and autonomic instability, which are not described in this case.\n\n#### **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with limbic encephalitis, characterized by subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes.

Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF and focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG are also consistent with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Weaknesses:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is more commonly seen in older adults, though it can occur in younger individuals.

Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can present with memory deficits, seizures, and confusion. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe involvement.\n- **Weaknesses:** This condition is more commonly associated with seizures as a prominent feature and often occurs in the context of an underlying malignancy (e.g., small-cell lung cancer). The patient's clinical presentation and lack of malignancy history make this less likely.\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and behavioral changes.

Let us analyze each option systematically in light of this presentation:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis often presents with psychiatric symptoms, memory deficits, confusion, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction.
