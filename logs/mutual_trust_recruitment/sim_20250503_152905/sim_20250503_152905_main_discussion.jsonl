Identifying the most likely autoantibody requires matching the clinical and imaging features to the known syndromes associated with each antibody.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a common form of autoimmune encephalitis. However, it typically presents with a more **heterogeneous syndrome**, including psychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation, hallucinations), seizures, autonomic instability, and movement disorders. MRI is often normal or nonspecific, and isolated medial temporal lobe involvement is less common.\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient's presentation of predominant **memory deficits and medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** is less characteristic of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This antibody is more commonly associated with younger patients and ovarian teratomas.\n- **Conclusion**: While possible, the presentation doesn't strongly fit anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Patients may also exhibit **faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS)**, although these are not mentioned in this case. The CSF findings of mild lymphocytic pleocytosis further support this diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant; this option aligns closely with the patient\u2019s presentation.\n- **Conclusion**: Anti-LGI1 antibodies are the most likely cause of this presentation.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis and medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. It is often associated with **seizures** and has a strong link to **underlying malignancies**, particularly small-cell lung cancer.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient has no mention of seizures or cancer, and the subacute presentation with memory and behavioral changes is less specific for GABA-B receptor encephalitis compared to LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Conclusion**: Possible but less likely than anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can also cause limbic encephalitis with memory deficits and behavioral changes. It is frequently associated with malignancies (e.g., thymoma, lung cancer).\n- **Weaknesses**: It is less common than anti-LGI1 or anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis and more often associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome. There is no indication of malignancy in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely than anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s presentation of **subacute memory deficits, behavioral changes, and medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** on MRI is classic for **limbic encephalitis**. Among the listed options, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most strongly associated with this clinical and imaging pattern. The absence of malignancy, seizures, or other systemic findings further supports this diagnosis over the alternatives (anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor antibodies). Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is less likely due to the lack of psychiatric symptoms, movement disorders, or autonomic instability."}

The MRI shows **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities**, which is a hallmark of **limbic encephalitis**. The CSF findings of **mild lymphocytic pleocytosis** indicate an inflammatory process, and the EEG findings of **focal slowing in the temporal regions** further localize the pathology to the temporal lobe. These findings strongly suggest **autoimmune encephalitis**, and the question asks us to identify the most likely associated autoantibody.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a common autoimmune encephalitis, but it typically presents with a **different clinical syndrome**. It often starts with psychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, paranoia), progresses to seizures, dyskinesias, autonomic instability, and hypoventilation. While memory deficits and confusion can occur, **medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are not a hallmark feature** of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: The MRI findings and the focus on limbic encephalitis make this less likely. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis often has a broader clinical spectrum and does not specifically localize to the medial temporal lobes.\n\n#### **B.
