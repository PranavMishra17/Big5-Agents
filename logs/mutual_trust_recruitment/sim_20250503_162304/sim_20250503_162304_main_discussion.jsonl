Identifying the specific autoantibody requires matching the clinical features with the known profiles of autoimmune encephalitis subtypes.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Associated Syndrome:** Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis often presents with psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, agitation), seizures, autonomic instability, and movement disorders. Memory deficits and confusion may occur, but MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are less common.\n- **Strengths:** Fits some aspects of the presentation (behavioral changes, confusion).\n- **Weaknesses:** MRI findings are atypical for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which often has normal imaging or nonspecific findings.\n\n#### **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Associated Syndrome:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with limbic encephalitis. Key features include subacute memory deficits, confusion, behavioral changes, and seizures. MRI often shows bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, and CSF findings may include mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. EEG findings of focal slowing in the temporal regions are common.\n- **Strengths:** This option matches the clinical presentation, imaging, CSF findings, and EEG abnormalities almost perfectly.\n- **Weaknesses:** None significant; highly likely based on the evidence.\n\n#### **C. Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Associated Syndrome:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is associated with limbic encephalitis but is more commonly seen in older adults and is strongly linked to underlying small-cell lung cancer. Symptoms include memory deficits, confusion, and seizures. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe involvement.\n- **Strengths:** Fits some aspects of the presentation (memory deficits, confusion, MRI findings).\n- **Weaknesses:** Less common in young adults and often paraneoplastic, which is not mentioned in this case.\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Associated Syndrome:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis, including memory deficits, confusion, and seizures. It is frequently paraneoplastic and more common in older adults. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe abnormalities.\n- **Strengths:** Fits some features (limbic encephalitis, MRI findings).\n- **Weaknesses:** Rare in young adults and often paraneoplastic, which is not described here.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation (subacute memory deficits, confusion, behavioral changes, bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and focal temporal slowing on EEG) is most consistent with **anti-LGI1 antibody-associated encephalitis**.\n\n- Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a classic cause of limbic encephalitis, particularly in younger adults.\n- The imaging, CSF, and EEG findings strongly align with this diagnosis.\n- There is no evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome, which makes anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor antibodies less likely.\n- Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis does not typically cause bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI.\n\n### Correct Answer: **B.

EEG shows **focal slowing in the temporal regions**. These findings strongly suggest **limbic encephalitis**, which is commonly associated with autoimmune processes and particular autoantibodies.\n\n### Systematic analysis of options:\n\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and sometimes autonomic instability or movement disorders. It can involve the medial temporal lobes but is more commonly associated with diffuse cortical involvement. CSF findings often include lymphocytic pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands.\n- **Weaknesses**: The hallmark of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is profound psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, agitation, catatonia) and movement disorders, which are not prominently described in this case. Memory deficits and medial temporal lobe involvement are less specific for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely in this case due to the absence of characteristic psychiatric symptoms or diffuse cortical involvement.\n\n#### **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with **limbic encephalitis**. It commonly presents with subacute **memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes**. MRI findings of **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** are classic.

Additionally, **facial or limb myoclonus (faciobrachial dystonic seizures)** may be seen, which is highly specific for anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None that are significant in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.\n\n#### **C. Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is also associated with limbic encephalitis and medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. It frequently presents with seizures as a prominent feature and can be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., small-cell lung cancer).\n- **Weaknesses**: Seizures are typically a dominant feature in anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis, whereas this case lacks seizure activity. The patient's presentation is more consistent with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely due to the absence of seizures and paraneoplastic associations.\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis, memory deficits, and behavioral changes. It is often paraneoplastic, particularly in older adults (e.g., lung or breast cancer).\n- **Weaknesses**: This condition is less common in younger individuals, and the imaging findings are less specific. The patient's age and lack of cancer history make this diagnosis less likely.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely in this case due to age and clinical presentation.\n\n### Final selection:\n**B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient's presentation of subacute **memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes**, combined with **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** on MRI, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF, and focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG, is highly characteristic of **anti-LGI1 encephalitis**.

It typically affects young women and may be associated with ovarian teratomas. However, MRI findings in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are often normal or nonspecific, and limbic encephalitis (medial temporal lobe hyperintensities) is less commonly seen.\n- **Weaknesses**: The MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities and focal slowing on EEG are more characteristic of other forms of autoimmune encephalitis, such as anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is less likely to present with a classic limbic encephalitis pattern.\n\n#### Option B: **Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a classic cause of limbic encephalitis, particularly in middle-aged adults, but it can also occur in younger patients. It commonly presents with memory deficits, confusion, behavioral changes, and seizures. MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis are hallmark features. Additionally, focal slowing on EEG in the temporal regions is consistent with this diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is more common in older adults (e.g., >50 years), but it is still possible in younger patients.\n\n#### Option C: **Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is associated with limbic encephalitis and can present with similar symptoms, including memory deficits, confusion, and seizures. MRI findings of medial temporal lobe hyperintensities and CSF pleocytosis may also be seen.\n- **Weaknesses**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is more commonly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and is less common in a young, otherwise healthy female patient. The clinical presentation is more suggestive of anti-LGI1 encephalitis in this case.\n\n#### Option D: **Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can also cause limbic encephalitis with similar imaging and CSF findings.

Behavioral changes can occur but are less prominent.\n- **MRI Findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities can be seen but are not specific.\n- **CSF Findings**: Lymphocytic pleocytosis may occur, consistent with this case.\n- **Conclusion**: While possible, the lack of an underlying malignancy and the prominence of behavioral changes make this option less likely.\n\n---\n\n### Selected Option:\n**B.
