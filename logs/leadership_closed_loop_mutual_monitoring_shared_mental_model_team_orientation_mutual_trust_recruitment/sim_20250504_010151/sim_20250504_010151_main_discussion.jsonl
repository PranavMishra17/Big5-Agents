While memory deficits and behavioral changes are possible, **MRI findings are often normal** or nonspecific in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n- **Strengths**: Behavioral changes and memory deficits can be seen.\n- **Weaknesses**: The hallmark MRI finding of medial temporal lobe hyperintensities is not typical for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\n---\n\n#### B. **Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Associated syndrome**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a classic cause of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. It typically presents with subacute memory loss, confusion, behavioral changes, and seizures. MRI commonly shows **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities**, consistent with this case. Patients may also have faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), which are highly specific but not always present.\n- **Strengths**: The clinical presentation (subacute memory deficits, behavioral changes) and MRI findings (medial temporal lobe hyperintensities) strongly align with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant based on the clinical presentation.\n\n---\n\n#### C. **Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Associated syndrome**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis also presents with a limbic encephalitis phenotype, including memory deficits, confusion, and seizures. MRI findings can include medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. However, it is more frequently associated with **underlying malignancies**, particularly small cell lung cancer, and is less common in young, otherwise healthy individuals.\n- **Strengths**: Limbic encephalitis features match.\n- **Weaknesses**: Less common in this demographic (32-year-old female without mention of malignancy).\n\n---\n\n#### D. **Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Associated syndrome**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can also cause limbic encephalitis with memory deficits and confusion. However, it is more commonly seen in older individuals and is frequently associated with malignancies. MRI findings can include medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, but this condition is much less common than anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Strengths**: Limbic encephalitis features match.\n- **Weaknesses**: Rare in this demographic and typically associated with malignancy.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely autoantibody associated with this clinical presentation is **anti-LGI1 antibodies**. The combination of subacute memory deficits, confusion, behavioral changes, and MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities is classic for anti-LGI1 encephalitis. This condition is also more common in this demographic compared to the other options.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**"}

The MRI findings of **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** suggest limbic encephalitis. The CSF findings of **mild lymphocytic pleocytosis** and the EEG showing **focal slowing in the temporal regions** further support the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The key task is to identify the most likely autoantibody associated with this presentation.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis often presents with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as confusion, memory deficits, and behavioral changes. However, it is more commonly associated with additional features such as seizures, movement abnormalities (e.g., orofacial dyskinesias), autonomic instability, and hypoventilation, which are not described in this case. MRI findings in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are often normal or nonspecific, and medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are less common.\n- **Weaknesses**: The presentation here is more specific for limbic encephalitis, which is less commonly caused by anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. The absence of hallmark features like seizures or dyskinesias makes this less likely.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely in this case.\n\n#### **B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a classic cause of limbic encephalitis. It typically presents with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes\u2014exactly as seen in this case. MRI findings often show bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, as described here. Additionally, anti-LGI1 encephalitis is associated with mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF and focal slowing on EEG, which are consistent with this patient\u2019s findings.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: Most likely explanation for this presentation.\n\n#### **C. Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can also present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and confusion. MRI findings can show medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. However, anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is strongly associated with seizures as a prominent feature, which is not reported in this case. It is also frequently associated with an underlying malignancy (e.g., small-cell lung cancer), which is not mentioned here.\n- **Weaknesses**: The absence of seizures and malignancy makes this less likely.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely in this case.\n\n#### **D. Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths**: Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can also present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and behavioral changes. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. However, this type of encephalitis is less common and is often associated with an underlying malignancy (e.g., breast or lung cancer), which is not mentioned here.\n- **Weaknesses**: The rarity of this condition and lack of malignancy make this less likely.\n- **Conclusion**: Less likely in this case.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\nThe clinical presentation, imaging findings, and CSF analysis are **most consistent with anti-LGI1 encephalitis**, a classic cause of limbic encephalitis.\n\n**Correct Answer: B. Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nAnti-LGI1 encephalitis is a well-recognized cause of limbic encephalitis, characterized by subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. The MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF, and focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG are all classic for this condition. Other options (anti-NMDA, anti-GABA-B, and anti-AMPA receptor antibodies) are less likely due to either the absence of hallmark features (e.g., seizures, movement abnormalities, or malignancy) or their lower prevalence in this specific presentation."}

However, it is more commonly associated with younger patients (children or young adults) and often affects both cortical and subcortical regions rather than being confined to the medial temporal lobes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are less typical for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which often shows normal imaging or nonspecific findings. The clinical presentation here lacks hallmark features of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, such as prominent psychiatric symptoms or movement disorders.\n\n#### **Option B: Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with **limbic encephalitis**, which presents with subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes. MRI findings of **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** are characteristic. This condition is also associated with focal seizures and hyponatremia, which may not be explicitly mentioned but could be present. The demographic (middle-aged female) aligns well with the typical presentation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- **Weaknesses:** None significant. This option matches the clinical picture most closely.\n\n#### **Option C: Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and confusion. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe hyperintensities. It is often associated with seizures and is commonly paraneoplastic, particularly in older patients with small-cell lung cancer.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient\u2019s age (32 years) and lack of paraneoplastic features make this less likely. Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis is more commonly seen in older individuals and is strongly linked to malignancy.\n\n#### **Option D: Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**\n- **Strengths:** Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis can present with limbic encephalitis symptoms, including memory deficits and confusion. MRI findings may show medial temporal lobe involvement. It is also frequently paraneoplastic.\n- **Weaknesses:** Similar to anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies, this condition is typically seen in older patients and is associated with malignancies.
