The patient's clinical presentation, mammographic findings, and biopsy results strongly support this conclusion:  \n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: Rapid onset of diffuse erythema, edema, thickened skin, ulceration, nipple discharge, and axillary/cervical adenopathy are hallmark features of IBC.  \n2. **Mammography Findings**: Parenchymal distortion, calcifications, and trabecular thickening are consistent with an aggressive malignancy like IBC.  \n3. **Pathology Findings**: Dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells is diagnostic for IBC and distinguishes it from other types of breast cancer.  \n4. **Family History**: A strong family history of breast cancer further supports the likelihood of malignancy.  \n\nOther options (LCIS, ILC, IDC) do not adequately explain the inflammatory presentation, rapid progression, or dermal lymphatic invasion seen in this case.
