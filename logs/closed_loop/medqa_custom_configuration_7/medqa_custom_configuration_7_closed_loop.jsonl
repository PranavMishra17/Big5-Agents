Core needle biopsy**\n\n### **Rationale:**\nAfter integrating my initial analysis and the perspectives provided by all team members, the consensus is clear that **core needle biopsy** is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation:** The patient has a firm, nontender breast mass identified on clinical examination and confirmed as suspicious on mammography. These findings warrant further investigation to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Hierarchy:** Before proceeding with treatment or staging investigations, a tissue diagnosis is essential. Core needle biopsy is the gold standard for evaluating suspicious breast lesions. It provides a histological diagnosis, which is critical for determining whether the mass is malignant or benign and for planning further management.\n\n3. **Minimally Invasive Approach:** Core needle biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that provides sufficient tissue for histopathological analysis while avoiding unnecessary surgical interventions at this stage.\n\n4. **Inappropriateness of Other Options:**\n   - **Bone scan (A):** Premature as there is no evidence of metastatic disease.\n   - **Serum CA 15\u20133 (B):** Not a diagnostic tool for initial evaluation of breast masses.\n   - **Mastectomy (C):** Inappropriate without a confirmed diagnosis of malignancy.\n\n5. **Evidence-Based Practice:** Current clinical guidelines and standard practices in breast cancer management support core needle biopsy as the next step for suspicious breast masses.\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the analyses of all team members and reflects a consensus built on clinical reasoning and evidence-based principles.", "acknowledgment": "**Acknowledgment:** I have received your message confirming the final answer as **D.

Core needle biopsy is minimally invasive and avoids unnecessary surgical interventions at this stage.\n4.
