Key findings include:\n- History of mild upper respiratory symptoms 10 days ago.\n- Normal vital signs except for a slightly elevated pulse (105/min).\n- Right hip slightly abducted and externally rotated.\n- No tenderness, warmth, or erythema.\n- Ability to bear weight.\n- Ultrasound showing increased joint fluid.\n- Normal X-ray findings.\n- Normal laboratory values (leukocyte count, ESR, hemoglobin).\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **Option A: Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)**\n- **Strengths**: SCFE typically presents with hip pain and limping in older children (usually adolescents, ages 10\u201316). The pain may radiate to the thigh or knee, and physical examination often shows limited internal rotation of the hip.\n- **Weaknesses**: SCFE is rare in children as young as 6 years old. Additionally, this patient\u2019s X-ray findings are normal, whereas SCFE would typically show displacement of the femoral head relative to the neck. The acute onset of symptoms is also atypical for SCFE, which usually develops gradually.\n- **Conclusion**: SCFE is unlikely in this case.\n\n#### **Option B: Transient Synovitis**\n- **Strengths**: Transient synovitis is a self-limited condition that commonly affects children aged 3\u20138 years. It often occurs after a viral illness (e.g., upper respiratory infection), as seen in this patient. Symptoms include acute hip pain, limping, and restricted movement. Ultrasound findings of increased joint fluid are consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of systemic signs (fever, elevated inflammatory markers) supports transient synovitis over other causes like septic arthritis.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant. The clinical presentation and diagnostic findings strongly align with transient synovitis.\n- **Conclusion**: Transient synovitis is highly likely in this case.\n\n#### **Option C: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease**\n- **Strengths**: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a condition characterized by avascular necrosis of the femoral head, typically occurring in children aged 4\u201310 years. Symptoms include hip pain, limping, and restricted movement.\n- **Weaknesses**: LCPD is a chronic condition that develops gradually rather than acutely. X-rays would typically show changes such as fragmentation or flattening of the femoral head, which are absent in this patient. The acute onset of symptoms and normal imaging findings make LCPD unlikely.\n- **Conclusion**: LCPD is unlikely in this case.\n\n#### **Option D: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)**\n- **Strengths**: DDH is a condition involving abnormal development of the hip joint, usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. It may present with limping or hip pain in older children if undiagnosed.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient has no history of DDH or abnormal findings on earlier examinations. The acute onset of symptoms and normal imaging findings make DDH unlikely. DDH typically presents with joint instability or subluxation, which is not observed in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: DDH is unlikely in this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Selected Option: B. Transient Synovitis**\n\n#### **Rationale**:\nThe clinical presentation (acute hip pain, limping, and restricted movement) in a previously healthy child aged 6 years, coupled with a recent viral illness, normal laboratory values, normal X-ray findings, and ultrasound evidence of joint effusion, is characteristic of **transient synovitis**. This is a self-limited inflammatory condition of the hip joint, commonly triggered by a preceding viral infection. The absence of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, elevated inflammatory markers) further supports this diagnosis over other conditions like septic arthritis.\n\nTransient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s age, acute presentation, and diagnostic findings.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B. Transient Synovitis**"}

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - SCFE typically presents with hip or knee pain and a limp in children, often during adolescence (ages 10\u201316), particularly in overweight or obese individuals.\n  - The hip may be externally rotated, as seen in this case.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - SCFE is rare in a 6-year-old child, as it is more common in older children during periods of rapid growth.\n  - There is no mention of obesity or other risk factors for SCFE.\n  - X-rays in SCFE typically show displacement of the femoral epiphysis, but this patient's X-rays are normal.\n\n#### **B. Transient synovitis**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Transient synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain and limping in children aged 3\u20138 years.\n  - It often follows a viral illness, as seen in this case (nasal congestion and mild cough 10 days ago).\n  - Symptoms include hip pain, limp, and sometimes mild fever. The hip may be held in a position of comfort (slight abduction and external rotation).\n  - Laboratory findings (normal leukocyte count and ESR) and imaging (increased joint fluid on ultrasound with normal X-rays) are consistent with transient synovitis.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - None significant in this case, as the clinical picture aligns well with transient synovitis.\n\n#### **C. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, which involves avascular necrosis of the femoral head, can present with hip pain and a limp in children aged 4\u201310 years.\n  - It may have a subacute presentation with minimal systemic symptoms.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - This condition is typically chronic and progresses over weeks to months, unlike the acute onset of symptoms in this case.\n  - X-rays in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often show abnormalities such as femoral head flattening or sclerosis, but this patient's X-rays are normal.\n\n#### **D. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - DDH can cause hip joint abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - DDH typically presents in infancy or early childhood with findings such as leg length discrepancy or limited hip abduction, not acute hip pain and limping in a previously healthy 6-year-old.\n  - Imaging findings in DDH would not be normal; abnormalities such as subluxation or dislocation of the hip would be expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Diagnosis and Rationale**\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is **B. Transient synovitis**. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1. **Age group**: Transient synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain in children aged 3\u20138 years.\n2. **History**: The child had a preceding viral illness, which is a common trigger for transient synovitis.\n3. **Acute onset**: Symptoms developed suddenly, which is consistent with transient synovitis.\n4. **Physical exam**: The child holds the hip in a position of comfort (slight abduction and external rotation) but has no signs of significant inflammation (no warmth, erythema, or marked tenderness).\n5. **Laboratory findings**: Normal leukocyte count and ESR support a benign, self-limited condition like transient synovitis.\n6. **Imaging**: Ultrasound shows joint effusion, which is typical for transient synovitis, and X-rays are normal, ruling out other structural abnormalities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B.

It is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3-8 years.\n2. The clinical presentation of acute hip pain and limping, with the hip held in slight abduction and external rotation, is classic.\n3. The history of a recent viral illness (URI 10 days ago) is a known trigger for transient synovitis.\n4. The child is afebrile, and laboratory studies (normal leukocyte count and ESR) do not indicate systemic inflammation or infection.\n5. Imaging findings (increased joint fluid on ultrasound, normal X-ray) are consistent with the diagnosis.\n\nThus, **B. Transient Synovitis** is the correct answer."}
