Cabergoline**\n\n### Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights provided by the team, the consensus is clear: the patient's symptoms (galactorrhea and amenorrhea) strongly suggest hyperprolactinemia as the underlying cause, likely due to a prolactinoma or other condition elevating prolactin levels. Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, is the first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia. It effectively reduces prolactin levels by stimulating dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary, resolving both galactorrhea and amenorrhea. None of the other options are appropriate or relevant therapies for this clinical scenario.", "acknowledgment": "Acknowledgment: I have received your message regarding the selection of **C. Cabergoline** as the most appropriate therapy for this patient scenario. \n\nConfirmation: To confirm my understanding, you have identified hyperprolactinemia as the likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms\u2014galactorrhea and amenorrhea. You explained that Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, is the first-line treatment because it suppresses prolactin secretion by stimulating dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary. This therapy directly addresses the root cause and resolves the patient's symptoms. None of the other options are relevant or suitable for this case.\n\nResponse: I fully agree with your analysis and rationale. Based on my expertise, the clinical presentation strongly supports hyperprolactinemia as the diagnosis, and Cabergoline is the optimal treatment.
