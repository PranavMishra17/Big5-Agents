Here's why:\n\n1. **Erythropoietin Level (\u2191)**: The move to a high-altitude environment like Denver leads to hypoxia due to reduced oxygen availability. This stimulates the kidneys to produce more erythropoietin to increase red blood cell production, a well-documented physiological response.\n\n2. **Oxygen Saturation (\u2193)**: At higher altitudes, the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere is lower, which reduces oxygen saturation in the blood until the body acclimatizes.\n\n3. **Plasma Volume (unchanged)**: In the acute phase (1 week), plasma volume remains relatively unchanged.
