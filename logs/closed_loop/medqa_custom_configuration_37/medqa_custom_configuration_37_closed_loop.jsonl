This decision is based on the following points:  \n\n1. **Neurological Symptoms with No Organic Findings:** The patient presents with right arm numbness and weakness, yet her reflexes are normal (2+ bilaterally) and CNS imaging shows no abnormalities. This strongly suggests a functional rather than structural or organic etiology.  \n\n2. **Psychosocial Context:** The recent traumatic loss of both parents in a motor vehicle accident is a significant psychological stressor, which is a common trigger for conversion disorder.  \n\n3. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses:**  \n   - **ALS** is ruled out due to the normal reflexes and imaging, as well as the patient's young age.  \n   - **Arnold-Chiari Malformation** is excluded due to the absence of imaging abnormalities and hallmark symptoms.  \n   - **MS** is unlikely given the normal imaging findings and reflexes, as well as the lack of other characteristic symptoms.  \n\nConversion disorder is the most plausible diagnosis after ruling out organic causes and considering the psychosocial context.
