Inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nThis patient's renal failure is most likely due to chronic NSAID use (naproxen), which is known to inhibit prostaglandin I2 production. Prostaglandins play a critical role in maintaining renal perfusion, and their inhibition by NSAIDs can lead to ischemic injury, particularly in the renal medulla. Over time, this can result in chronic interstitial nephritis and renal papillary necrosis, which are consistent with the findings of shrunken kidneys, papillary calcifications, and mild proteinuria. The chronicity of the symptoms, absence of acute features (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia), and imaging findings strongly support NSAID-induced nephropathy as the underlying mechanism.", "acknowledgment": "Acknowledged.
