MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Integrated Rationale:\nAll analyses, including my own and those of the teammates, converge on the conclusion that the patient's clinical presentation is consistent with **central cord syndrome (CCS)**, a spinal cord injury commonly seen in older adults after cervical trauma. The neurologic findings\u2014greater motor and sensory deficits in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities, intact bowel and bladder function, and absent upper extremity reflexes\u2014strongly suggest spinal cord involvement localized to the cervical region.\n\nMRI of the cervical spine is the **gold standard** imaging modality for confirming the cause of these findings. It provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, allowing for the identification of spinal cord edema, compression, hemorrhage, or other abnormalities characteristic of CCS. Other options, such as CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-ray, are either insufficient or outdated for evaluating the spinal cord and soft tissue structures.
