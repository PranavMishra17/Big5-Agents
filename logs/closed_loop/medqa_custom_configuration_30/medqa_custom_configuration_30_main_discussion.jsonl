CCS typically occurs in older adults with cervical spine trauma, often in the setting of preexisting cervical spine degeneration. The hallmark of CCS is greater motor and sensory impairment in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities, with preservation of bowel and bladder function. The patient's presentation aligns with this diagnosis.\n\nTo confirm the cause of these findings, imaging of the cervical spine and spinal cord is required to identify structural abnormalities, such as spinal cord compression, edema, or hemorrhage.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries, which can occur with trauma. It provides excellent visualization of vascular structures.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient's neurologic findings are not suggestive of vascular injury but rather spinal cord injury. CT angiography does not provide detailed visualization of the spinal cord or soft tissue structures and would not confirm the cause of the neurologic deficits.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is not appropriate for confirming the cause of the patient's neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots, often combined with CT imaging. It can detect spinal cord compression or structural abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is rarely used today due to the availability of MRI, which provides superior visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures without requiring invasive procedures. MRI is the preferred modality for diagnosing spinal cord injuries.\n- **Conclusion**: While myelography could theoretically provide information, it is not the best option given the availability of MRI.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-ray is useful for identifying bony abnormalities, such as fractures or dislocations, and can be performed quickly in the emergency setting.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-ray cannot visualize the spinal cord or soft tissue structures, which are critical for diagnosing central cord syndrome. It is insufficient to confirm the cause of the neurologic findings in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: X-ray alone is inadequate for diagnosing the underlying spinal cord injury.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord, including edema, hemorrhage, and compression, as well as surrounding soft tissue structures. It is non-invasive and does not require contrast for this type of evaluation.\n- **Weaknesses**: MRI may take longer to perform compared to CT or X-ray, but this is not a significant limitation in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: MRI is the best option for confirming the cause of the patient's neurologic findings, as it directly visualizes the spinal cord and can identify the features of central cord syndrome.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\n\nThe most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the cause of this patient's neurologic findings is **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**. MRI provides the best visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, allowing for the identification of central cord syndrome and any associated spinal cord pathology.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**"}

This pattern is consistent with **central cord syndrome**, a common incomplete spinal cord injury often seen in elderly patients after cervical hyperextension injuries (e.g., falls). The presence of midline cervical tenderness, bruising, and neurologic findings localized to the upper extremities strongly suggests cervical spinal cord involvement.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries, such as vertebral artery dissection or thrombosis, which may occur with cervical trauma. It provides detailed imaging of the vasculature.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s neurologic findings are more consistent with spinal cord injury (central cord syndrome) rather than a vascular injury. CT angiography would not confirm the cause of the neurologic deficits.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the best choice for confirming the cause of the neurologic findings.\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal and using imaging (usually CT) to visualize spinal cord compression or abnormalities. It can be helpful for identifying spinal cord lesions or stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is invasive and largely replaced by MRI for evaluating spinal cord injuries. MRI provides superior soft tissue detail without requiring contrast injection.\n- **Conclusion**: Not the preferred diagnostic modality in this case.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays can identify fractures, dislocations, or gross cervical spine abnormalities. They are quick and widely available.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays have limited sensitivity for soft tissue injuries, including spinal cord damage. They cannot evaluate the spinal cord or confirm central cord syndrome.\n- **Conclusion**: Insufficient for confirming the cause of the neurologic deficits.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord, including edema, hemorrhage, compression, and other soft tissue injuries. In cases of central cord syndrome, MRI can confirm the diagnosis by showing spinal cord signal changes (e.g., edema) and any contributing factors (e.g., ligamentous injury, spinal stenosis).\n- **Weaknesses**: None relevant to this case. MRI is non-invasive and highly accurate.\n- **Conclusion**: The best choice for confirming the cause of the neurologic findings.\n\n### Selected Option:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation is consistent with central cord syndrome, likely due to a cervical hyperextension injury sustained during the fall. MRI of the cervical spine is the most appropriate diagnostic modality to confirm this diagnosis as it provides detailed imaging of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. It can identify spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression, which are typical findings in central cord syndrome. Additionally, MRI can rule out other potential causes of the neurologic deficits, such as spinal stenosis or ligamentous injury.\n\n"}

CCS is characterized by greater motor and sensory impairment in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities, with sparing of bowel and bladder function.\n\n#### Diagnostic Goal:\nThe goal is to **confirm the cause of the neurologic findings**, which is likely a spinal cord injury or compression in the cervical region. This will require imaging of the cervical spine to evaluate the spinal cord and surrounding structures.\n\n---\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. CT angiography of the neck**\n- **Strengths**: CT angiography is useful for evaluating vascular injuries (e.g., vertebral artery dissection) or other vascular abnormalities in the neck.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient\u2019s symptoms are primarily neurologic and localized to the spinal cord. There is no indication of vascular injury (e.g., no signs of stroke, ischemia, or vertebral artery compromise). CT angiography would not provide adequate information about the spinal cord or soft tissue structures.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s findings.\n\n#### **B. Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Myelography involves injecting contrast into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots, and it can detect spinal cord compression or abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: While effective, myelography is an invasive procedure that has largely been replaced by MRI, which provides superior soft tissue detail without requiring contrast injection. It is no longer the first-line imaging modality for spinal cord injuries.\n- **Conclusion**: Outdated and less practical compared to MRI.\n\n#### **C. X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays can detect fractures, dislocations, and gross bony abnormalities of the cervical spine. They are quick and accessible in emergency settings.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays cannot visualize the spinal cord, soft tissues, or intervertebral discs. They are insufficient for evaluating spinal cord injuries or central cord syndrome, which involves soft tissue and neural structures.\n- **Conclusion**: Insufficient for confirming the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n#### **D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, ligaments, and surrounding soft tissues. It can confirm spinal cord compression, edema, or hemorrhage, which are consistent with central cord syndrome.\n- **Weaknesses**: MRI may not be immediately available in all emergency settings, but it is the most definitive test for this patient\u2019s condition.\n- **Conclusion**: The best imaging modality to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n#### Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation strongly suggests **central cord syndrome** due to a hyperextension injury in an elderly patient with likely cervical spondylosis. MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis, as it provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. Other options (CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-ray) are either insufficient or outdated for this purpose. MRI will confirm the presence of spinal cord edema, compression, or other abnormalities causing the neurologic deficits."}

It provides detailed imaging of blood vessels in the neck.\n- **Weaknesses**: While vascular injuries can cause neurologic symptoms, the patient\u2019s findings (weakness and sensory deficits in the upper extremities, intact lower extremities, and absent reflexes) strongly suggest a spinal cord injury rather than a vascular etiology. This imaging modality does not directly address the suspected spinal cord pathology.\n\n#### **Option B: Cervical myelography**\n- **Strengths**: Cervical myelography involves injecting contrast into the spinal canal and then performing imaging to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots. It was historically used to evaluate spinal cord injuries or compressive lesions.\n- **Weaknesses**: Myelography is largely replaced by MRI, which provides superior visualization of the spinal cord, soft tissues, and any compressive pathology without the need for invasive contrast injection. It is less commonly used in modern practice.\n\n#### **Option C: X-ray of the cervical spine**\n- **Strengths**: X-rays are quick and readily available, and they can identify fractures or gross cervical spine alignment abnormalities.\n- **Weaknesses**: X-rays are limited in their ability to evaluate soft tissue structures, including the spinal cord, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. Given the neurologic findings, a soft tissue injury or spinal cord pathology is more likely, which X-ray cannot adequately assess.\n\n#### **Option D: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n- **Strengths**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating spinal cord injuries, including hemorrhage, edema, or compression due to fractures, ligament injuries, or disc herniation. It provides detailed imaging of the spinal cord and surrounding soft tissues, making it ideal for this patient\u2019s neurologic deficits.\n- **Weaknesses**: None significant in this context. MRI is readily available in most emergency settings and is non-invasive.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation is consistent with **central cord syndrome**, a type of incomplete spinal cord injury often seen in older adults with cervical spine trauma. Central cord syndrome typically results in weakness and sensory deficits in the upper extremities, with relative sparing of the lower extremities. MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis, as it can visualize spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, and any compressive lesions.\n\n---\n\n### Selected Option:\n**D. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nMRI is the most likely imaging modality to confirm the cause of this patient\u2019s neurologic findings. It provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, allowing identification of central cord syndrome or other spinal cord pathologies. The neurologic deficits, particularly affecting the upper extremities, point to a spinal cord injury, which MRI is best suited to evaluate. Other options (CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-ray) are either less specific or outdated for this purpose."}
