This patient, at 72 years old, belongs to the demographic with the highest risk. Age-related factors such as accumulated genetic mutations, reduced immune surveillance, and cellular senescence contribute substantially to the development of colorectal cancer.\n- Other options, such as **low dietary fiber intake (Option A)**, are modifiable lifestyle factors and less significant compared to non-modifiable factors like age. Similarly, **low-dose aspirin use (Option C)** and **naproxen use (Option D)** are not risk factors for colorectal cancer; in fact, aspirin may have a protective effect.\n\nAll analyses align in identifying **increasing age** as the most significant risk factor.
