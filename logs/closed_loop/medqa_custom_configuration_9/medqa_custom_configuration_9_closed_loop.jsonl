Breast ultrasound**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights provided by my teammates, it is clear that **breast ultrasound** is the most appropriate next step in the management of this 28-year-old woman with a newly discovered breast mass. Ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality for women under 30 years of age due to the density of their breast tissue, which limits the sensitivity of mammography. Ultrasound can effectively differentiate between solid and cystic masses and provide valuable information about the lesion's characteristics (e.g., shape, borders, vascularity).  \n\nMammography (Option B) is less effective in younger women and is typically reserved for women over 30 or for further evaluation after initial imaging.
