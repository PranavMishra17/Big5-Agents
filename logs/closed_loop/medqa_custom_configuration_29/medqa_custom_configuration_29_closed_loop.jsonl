A 50% stenosis corresponds to a halving of the vessel radius. According to the law, resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (\\(R \\propto 1/r^4\\)). Halving the radius increases resistance by \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\)-fold.  \n\nThis aligns with the clinical presentation of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) caused by embolization from the stenotic left internal carotid artery. The 16-fold increase in resistance explains the reduced blood flow and embolic events leading to the patient's symptoms.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **C.
