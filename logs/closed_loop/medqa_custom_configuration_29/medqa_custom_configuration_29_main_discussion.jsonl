Let's analyze the scenario and options systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Information from the Question**\n1. **Symptoms and History**:\n   - The patient experienced sudden-onset right-sided weakness, sensory loss, and difficulty forming sentences, consistent with a **transient ischemic attack (TIA)**.\n   - A prior episode of transient visual loss in the left eye (amaurosis fugax) suggests **embolization from the left carotid artery**.\n\n2. **Findings**:\n   - Carotid Doppler shows **50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery**, which is the most likely source of embolization causing the symptoms.\n   - Based on fluid dynamics, stenosis significantly increases resistance to blood flow.\n\n3. **Relevant Principle**:\n   - According to **Poiseuille's law**, resistance (\\(R\\)) to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (\\(r\\)) of the vessel:\n     \\[\n     R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n     \\]\n   - A reduction in the radius (e.g., due to stenosis) leads to an exponential increase in resistance.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of the Options**\n\n#### **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - This option aligns with a moderate increase in resistance due to stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - A 50% stenosis implies the radius is halved. Since resistance is proportional to \\(1/r^4\\), halving the radius increases resistance by \\(2^4 = 16\\)-fold, not 4-fold.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n#### **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Suggests a significant increase in resistance, which is plausible in cases of moderate stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - The resistance increase due to a 50% reduction in radius would be \\(16\\)-fold, not \\(8\\)-fold. This option underestimates the exponential relationship.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C: It will be 16 times greater**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - This option correctly applies Poiseuille's law. A 50% reduction in radius means the new radius is half the original, and \\(1/(0.5^4) = 16\\). Thus, resistance increases 16-fold.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - None. This is consistent with the mathematical relationship.\n- **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - A valid choice if there were no stenosis or if the question referred to a non-stenotic artery.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - A 50% stenosis clearly increases resistance. This option disregards the physiological and fluid dynamics principles.\n- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Answer: C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n---\n\n### **Rationale**\n1. The patient\u2019s symptoms are due to embolization from the left internal carotid artery, where Doppler imaging shows 50% stenosis.\n2. Using **Poiseuille's law**, a 50% reduction in the radius increases resistance to blood flow by \\(16\\)-fold.\n3. This increase in resistance, combined with other factors like turbulence and plaque formation, predisposes the patient to embolization and TIA.\n\nThus, the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery is **16 times greater**."}

I will analyze the question systematically, evaluate the options, and provide a detailed rationale for the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question:\nThe patient has presented with transient neurological symptoms, including right-sided weakness, decreased sensation, and difficulty forming sentences, which resolved almost instantaneously. He also has a history of transient painless visual loss in his left eye. These episodes are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), likely due to emboli originating from atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries. The carotid Doppler ultrasound reveals 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, which is likely the culprit for the current symptoms.\n\nThe question asks about the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery responsible for the symptoms. This requires application of **Poiseuille's Law**, which describes the relationship between vessel radius and resistance to blood flow.\n\n### Relevant Principle:\nAccording to **Poiseuille's Law**, resistance to blood flow (R) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r):\n\\[\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n\\]\nThis means that even small changes in the radius of a vessel result in significant changes in resistance. For example:\n- If the radius is halved, resistance increases by \\(2^4 = 16\\)-fold.\n- If the radius is reduced to one-third, resistance increases by \\(3^4 = 81\\)-fold.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n#### **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n- A 4-fold increase in resistance implies a relatively mild reduction in vessel radius. However, this does not align with the degree of stenosis observed (50%), which suggests a more significant reduction in radius and a correspondingly larger increase in resistance.\n- **Weakness**: Underestimates the impact of a 50% reduction in radius.\n\n#### **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n- An 8-fold increase in resistance corresponds to a moderate reduction in radius. However, this also underestimates the resistance change expected from a 50% stenosis, which involves a substantial narrowing of the vessel.\n- **Weakness**: Still underestimates the magnitude of resistance change.\n\n#### **Option C: It will be 16 times greater**\n- A 16-fold increase in resistance aligns with the expected change for a 50% reduction in radius, as per Poiseuille's Law. If the radius is halved (as in 50% stenosis), resistance increases by \\(2^4 = 16\\)-fold.\n- **Strength**: Accurately reflects the mathematical relationship between radius and resistance in the context of significant stenosis.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- This option suggests that stenosis has no impact on resistance, which is incorrect. Stenosis significantly increases resistance due to the narrowing of the vessel lumen.\n- **Weakness**: Contradicts established physiological principles.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with TIAs caused by emboli originating from the stenotic left internal carotid artery. Based on Poiseuille's Law, a 50% reduction in vessel radius results in a 16-fold increase in resistance to blood flow. This aligns with the degree of stenosis observed on Doppler ultrasound and the physiological principles governing blood flow dynamics.\n\nConfirming understanding: The correct answer is **C**, based on the mathematical relationship between vessel radius and resistance as described by Poiseuille's Law. Let me know if clarification is needed."}

The symptoms, particularly the painless visual loss in the left eye (amaurosis fugax), are consistent with ischemia due to carotid artery stenosis. The question focuses on the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery most likely responsible for the symptoms. This requires applying **fluid dynamics principles**, particularly **Poiseuille\u2019s law**, which governs blood flow through vessels.\n\n---\n\n### Key Principle:\n**Poiseuille's Law** states that resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel:\n\\[\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n\\]\nWhere **R** is resistance and **r** is the radius of the vessel. A small decrease in the radius leads to a significant increase in resistance.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Options:\n\n#### **Option A: Resistance will be 4 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This option assumes a moderate reduction in the radius of the artery. However, per Poiseuille\u2019s law, the resistance increase is proportional to the fourth power of the radius change, making this option unlikely unless the stenosis is minor.\n- **Weaknesses**: The degree of stenosis described (50% narrowing in the left carotid artery) suggests a more significant increase in resistance than 4 times.\n\n#### **Option B: Resistance will be 8 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This option suggests a more substantial increase in resistance. However, the increase in resistance due to a halving of the radius (50% stenosis) should be even greater than 8 times.\n- **Weaknesses**: It does not align with the fourth-power relationship of Poiseuille\u2019s law for significant stenosis.\n\n#### **Option C: Resistance will be 16 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: This option correctly reflects the fourth-power relationship of Poiseuille\u2019s law. A 50% stenosis implies the radius is halved, and \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{(0.5)^4} = 16 \\). This is the expected increase in resistance due to the degree of narrowing described.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This option aligns with the fluid dynamics principles governing blood flow.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- **Strengths**: This might be considered if the stenosis is minimal (e.g., 10% narrowing in the right carotid artery). However, the left carotid artery has 50% stenosis, which would significantly increase resistance.\n- **Weaknesses**: This option contradicts the pathophysiology of carotid stenosis and the principles of Poiseuille\u2019s law.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient's symptoms are likely due to transient ischemia caused by the 50% stenosis in the left carotid artery. According to Poiseuille\u2019s law, halving the radius of a vessel results in a 16-fold increase in resistance to blood flow. This significant increase in resistance reduces blood flow to downstream tissues, causing transient ischemic symptoms. The unremarkable CT scan suggests no permanent damage, further supporting the TIA diagnosis.\n\nThis choice aligns with both the clinical presentation and the physical principles governing blood flow through stenotic arteries."}

The resistance to flow (R) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the vessel:\n\\[\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n\\]\nThis means that even small decreases in the radius of a vessel result in significant increases in resistance. For example:\n- If the radius is reduced to half (50% stenosis), the resistance increases by a factor of \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of Options:\n#### **Option A: It will be 4 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: Suggests a moderate increase in resistance due to narrowing of the vessel.\n- **Weaknesses**: A 4-fold increase in resistance corresponds to a radius reduction of approximately \\( \\sqrt[4]{4} = 0.84 \\) (16% reduction in radius). However, with 50% stenosis (a 50% reduction in diameter), the resistance increase is much greater than 4-fold. This option underestimates the effect.\n\n#### **Option B: It will be 8 times greater**\n- **Strengths**: Suggests a significant increase in resistance due to stenosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: A resistance increase of 8-fold corresponds to a radius reduction of approximately \\( \\sqrt[4]{8} = 0.71 \\) (29% reduction in radius).

A 50% stenosis (reduction in diameter) corresponds to a 50% reduction in radius, which increases resistance by \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\).\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This option aligns perfectly with the principles of fluid dynamics.\n\n#### **Option D: No change**\n- **Strengths**: None. This option ignores the impact of stenosis on resistance to blood flow.\n- **Weaknesses**: Directly contradicts Poiseuille's law, which predicts a significant increase in resistance with vessel narrowing.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with TIAs caused by emboli originating from the stenotic left internal carotid artery. The degree of stenosis (50%) corresponds to a 50% reduction in the vessel's radius. According to Poiseuille's law, resistance to blood flow increases by the fourth power of the inverse of the radius. Thus, a 50% reduction in radius results in a \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\)-fold increase in resistance. This significant increase in resistance reduces blood flow and predisposes to embolic events, explaining the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\n"}
