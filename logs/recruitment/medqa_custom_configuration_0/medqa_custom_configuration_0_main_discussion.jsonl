This morphological change is due to the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which distorts the shape of red blood cells.\n\n3. **Mechanism of Disease**:\n   - Sickle cell disease results from a **missense mutation** in the HBB gene on chromosome 11. This mutation leads to the production of hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped. These cells obstruct blood flow, leading to pain crises and organ damage.\n\n### Analysis of Other Options:\n- **A. Frameshift mutation**:\n  - Frameshift mutations involve insertion or deletion of nucleotides that disrupt the reading frame of a gene. These typically result in a completely nonfunctional protein, which is not the mechanism in sickle cell disease.\n\n- **B. Mismatch repair**:\n  - Mismatch repair refers to a DNA repair system that corrects errors during DNA replication. Defects in mismatch repair are associated with conditions like Lynch syndrome, not sickle cell disease.\n\n- **C. Silent mutation**:\n  - Silent mutations do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein and therefore do not alter its function. This is not relevant to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.\n\n- **D. Missense mutation**:\n  - Missense mutations result in a single amino acid substitution, which is precisely the mechanism in sickle cell disease (glutamic acid \u2192 valine in the beta-globin chain).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe clinical presentation, family history, and likely findings on the peripheral smear are consistent with sickle cell disease, which is caused by a **missense mutation**. Thus, the correct answer is **D**."}

Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Clinical Scenario:\n1. **Presentation**: The patient is an 8-year-old African-American boy presenting with severe pain in both hands (a classic symptom of vaso-occlusive crisis), a fever with a cough (possible trigger for sickling episodes), and a family history of a relative who died from a blood disease.\n2. **Peripheral Blood Smear**: While the image is not visible here, the description strongly suggests findings consistent with sickle cell disease, such as sickle-shaped red blood cells.\n3. **Family History and Ethnicity**: Sickle cell disease is more prevalent in individuals of African descent, and the family history of a blood disease aligns with an inherited condition like sickle cell anemia.\n\n### Genetic Basis of Sickle Cell Disease:\nSickle cell disease is caused by a **missense mutation** in the **HBB gene**, which encodes the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. Specifically, this mutation involves a single nucleotide substitution (GAG \u2192 GTG) in codon 6 of the beta-globin gene, resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid with valine (E6V). This substitution causes hemoglobin to polymerize under low oxygen conditions, leading to the characteristic sickling of red blood cells, vaso-occlusion, and hemolysis.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options:\n1. **A. Frameshift mutation**:\n   - A frameshift mutation results from insertions or deletions of nucleotides that shift the reading frame, leading to completely altered or truncated proteins. \n   - This is not the mechanism in sickle cell disease, as the condition involves a specific point mutation (not a frameshift).\n\n2. **B. Mismatch repair**:\n   - Mismatch repair is a DNA repair mechanism that corrects errors made during DNA replication. Defects in mismatch repair are associated with conditions like Lynch syndrome, not sickle cell disease.\n   - This does not apply to the pathogenesis of the patient's condition.\n\n3. **C. Silent mutation**:\n   - A silent mutation is a nucleotide change that does not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. These mutations are typically not pathogenic.\n   - Sickle cell disease is caused by a missense mutation, not a silent mutation.\n\n4. **D. Missense mutation**:\n   - A missense mutation changes a single nucleotide, resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein product. This is the exact mechanism underlying sickle cell disease.\n   - The E6V mutation in the HBB gene is a classic example of a missense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms, ethnicity, family history, and the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease all point to a missense mutation in the HBB gene as the underlying mechanism. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Missense mutation**."}

Let\u2019s analyze the case and options systematically:\n\n### Case Breakdown:\n1. **Demographics and Symptoms**:\n   - The patient is an 8-year-old African-American boy, a demographic with a higher prevalence of sickle cell disease.\n   - Severe pain in both hands indicates a vaso-occlusive crisis, a hallmark of sickle cell disease.\n   - Fever and cough preceding the crisis suggest a possible infection, which is a common trigger for vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD.\n\n2. **Family History**:\n   - The uncle\u2019s death from a \"blood disease\" is suggestive of a genetic condition like sickle cell disease.\n\n3. **Peripheral Blood Smear**:\n   - While the image is not visible here, sickle cell disease is characterized by the presence of sickled red blood cells on a peripheral smear.\n\n4. **Pathophysiology**:\n   - Sickle cell disease is caused by a **missense mutation** in the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB), where glutamic acid is substituted with valine at position 6 of the \u03b2-globin chain (Glu6Val). This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to sickle and obstruct blood flow.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **A. Frameshift mutation**:\n  - A frameshift mutation results from insertions or deletions of nucleotides that alter the reading frame of the genetic code. While frameshift mutations can cause severe genetic disorders, they are not the mechanism for sickle cell disease. This option is incorrect.\n\n- **B. Mismatch repair**:\n  - Mismatch repair is a DNA repair process that corrects errors during DNA replication. Defects in mismatch repair are associated with conditions like Lynch syndrome, not sickle cell disease. This option is incorrect.\n\n- **C. Silent mutation**:\n  - A silent mutation changes a nucleotide without altering the amino acid sequence of the protein. Since sickle cell disease involves a functional change in the \u03b2-globin protein, a silent mutation cannot be the mechanism. This option is incorrect.\n\n- **D.

This is supported by the patient's ethnicity (African-American), symptoms (severe pain in both hands, which is characteristic of vaso-occlusive crisis), and family history of a blood disease (likely related to sickle cell anemia). The peripheral blood smear in sickle cell disease typically shows sickle-shaped erythrocytes, which are abnormal red blood cells caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene.\n\nNow, let us analyze the options systematically:\n\n1. **A. Frameshift mutation**: A frameshift mutation occurs when nucleotides are inserted or deleted, disrupting the reading frame of the genetic code. While frameshift mutations can lead to significant changes in protein structure and function, they are not the mechanism underlying sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide substitution, not a frameshift mutation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n2. **B. Mismatch repair**: Mismatch repair refers to the cellular mechanism that corrects errors during DNA replication. Defects in mismatch repair are associated with certain cancers, such as Lynch syndrome, but they are not relevant to sickle cell disease. Hence, this option is incorrect.\n\n3. **C. Silent mutation**: A silent mutation is a change in a nucleotide that does not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. Silent mutations do not typically result in disease because the protein function remains unchanged. However, sickle cell disease arises from a mutation that does affect the amino acid sequence and protein function. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n4. **D. Missense mutation**: A missense mutation refers to a single nucleotide substitution that results in the replacement of one amino acid with another in the protein sequence. Sickle cell disease is caused by a missense mutation in the beta-globin gene, where valine replaces glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin chain (Glu \u2192 Val). This substitution causes the hemoglobin molecules to polymerize under low oxygen conditions, leading to the characteristic sickle shape of red blood cells and the clinical manifestations of the disease. Thus, this is the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely mechanism for this patient\u2019s disease is a missense mutation."}
