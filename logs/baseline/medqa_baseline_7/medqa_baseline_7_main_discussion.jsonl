The mammogram shows a suspicious 2-cm lesion. This clinical presentation raises significant concern for breast cancer, given the presence of a palpable abnormality and suspicious imaging findings. The question asks for the most appropriate next step in management.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option\n\n#### **Option A: Bone scan**\n- **Strengths:** A bone scan is used to detect metastatic disease, particularly in breast cancer patients who are diagnosed with advanced disease or have symptoms suggestive of metastasis (e.g., bone pain). Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones.\n- **Weaknesses:** This option is premature in the diagnostic process because the patient has not yet been definitively diagnosed with cancer. A bone scan is not appropriate as the first step in evaluating a breast mass. The priority is confirming the diagnosis before assessing for metastasis.\n\n#### **Option B: Measurement of serum CA 15-3**\n- **Strengths:** CA 15-3 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in breast cancer, particularly in metastatic disease. It may be useful for monitoring treatment response or recurrence in patients with established breast cancer.\n- **Weaknesses:** Tumor markers like CA 15-3 are not used for initial diagnosis of breast cancer. They lack sensitivity and specificity for early-stage disease and are not appropriate for evaluating a suspicious breast mass. This option does not address the need for tissue diagnosis.\n\n#### **Option C: Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths:** Mastectomy is a definitive surgical treatment for breast cancer and may be indicated in certain cases (e.g., large tumors, patient preference, or inability to perform breast-conserving surgery).\n- **Weaknesses:** Performing a mastectomy before confirming the diagnosis of cancer is inappropriate. The patient requires a biopsy to establish the histopathological diagnosis before treatment decisions can be made. This option bypasses the critical diagnostic step.\n\n#### **Option D: Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths:** A core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a tissue diagnosis of a suspicious breast mass. It is minimally invasive, provides histological information, and allows for assessment of hormone receptor status and other markers if cancer is confirmed.\n- **Weaknesses:** There are no significant weaknesses for this option in the context of the presented case. It addresses the immediate need for diagnosis and guides subsequent management.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Principles\n1. **Diagnostic Hierarchy:** The first step in managing a suspicious breast mass is confirming the diagnosis through tissue sampling. Imaging studies like mammography provide supportive information but are insufficient for definitive diagnosis.\n2. **Minimally Invasive Approach:** Core needle biopsy is preferred over more invasive procedures (e.g., surgical biopsy) for diagnosis, as it is less burdensome to the patient and provides adequate diagnostic information.\n3. **Avoid Premature Interventions:** Therapeutic actions (e.g., mastectomy) or metastatic workups (e.g., bone scan) should only follow confirmation of malignancy.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale\n#### **Correct Answer: D. Core needle biopsy**\n- **Rationale:** The patient's clinical and imaging findings are concerning for breast cancer. The most appropriate next step is obtaining a tissue diagnosis via core needle biopsy, which is minimally invasive and provides definitive histopathological information. This step is essential for guiding subsequent management, including staging and treatment planning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n**D. Core needle biopsy**"}

The mammogram reveals a suspicious 2-cm mass adjacent to the nipple. The clinical presentation raises concern for breast cancer, particularly given her age, nulliparity (a risk factor), and history of hormone replacement therapy (another risk factor). The next step should aim to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### **Option A: Bone scan**\n- **Strengths**: Bone scans are useful for detecting bone metastases in patients with known breast cancer, particularly if there is evidence of advanced disease (e.g., bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, or other signs of metastasis).\n- **Weaknesses**: In this case, there is no confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer yet, and there are no clinical signs or symptoms of metastatic disease. A bone scan would be premature without first establishing the diagnosis of malignancy.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate at this stage.\n\n#### **Option B: Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133**\n- **Strengths**: Serum CA 15\u20133 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in breast cancer, particularly in advanced or metastatic disease. It can be useful for monitoring treatment response or detecting recurrence in patients with a confirmed diagnosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Tumor markers like CA 15\u20133 are not diagnostic tools and are not helpful in the initial evaluation of a suspicious breast mass. They are not sensitive or specific enough to establish the presence of breast cancer.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate as the next step.\n\n#### **Option C: Mastectomy**\n- **Strengths**: Mastectomy is a definitive treatment for breast cancer, particularly in cases where breast-conserving therapy is not feasible or for patients with large tumors or multifocal disease.\n- **Weaknesses**: It is premature to proceed directly to surgery without confirming the diagnosis of breast cancer. The patient needs a biopsy to establish malignancy before considering surgical options.\n- **Conclusion**: Not appropriate as the next step.\n\n#### **Option D: Core needle biopsy**\n- **Strengths**: A core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a tissue diagnosis in patients with a suspicious breast mass. It allows histopathologic evaluation to confirm malignancy and provides information on tumor type, grade, and receptor status (e.g., estrogen receptor, HER2), which are critical for treatment planning.\n- **Weaknesses**: None in this scenario. This is the most logical and evidence-based next step.\n- **Conclusion**: Most appropriate next step.\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n1. **Diagnostic Confirmation**: In cases of suspected malignancy, tissue diagnosis is essential before initiating treatment or further evaluation for staging.\n2. **Minimally Invasive Testing**: A core needle biopsy is preferred over surgical biopsy for initial evaluation as it is less invasive, cost-effective, and provides adequate diagnostic information.\n3. **Sequential Management**: Further steps (e.g., imaging for metastasis, surgical planning) depend on the biopsy results.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D. Core needle biopsy**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient presents with a suspicious breast mass and mammographic findings suggestive of malignancy. Core needle biopsy is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis, determine the nature of the lesion, and guide subsequent management. Other options, such as bone scans or tumor marker measurement, are not diagnostic tools and are reserved for staging or monitoring in confirmed cases of malignancy. Proceeding directly to mastectomy without a confirmed diagnosis would be inappropriate and premature."}

Core needle biopsy**\n\n---\n\n### **Rationale:**\nThe patient presents with a suspicious breast mass that has been confirmed on mammography. The next step in management is to establish a definitive diagnosis through tissue sampling. Core needle biopsy is minimally invasive, allows for histologic evaluation, and provides critical information about the nature of the mass (benign vs malignant). This step is essential before proceeding with treatment planning, which could include surgery, chemotherapy, or other interventions if malignancy is confirmed.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are either irrelevant or premature in the diagnostic process, making Option D the most appropriate choice."}
