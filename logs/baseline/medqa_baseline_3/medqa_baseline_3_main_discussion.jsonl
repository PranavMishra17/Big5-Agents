On the second post-operative day, he demonstrates oliguria (300 mL urine output in 24 hours) and urinalysis reveals hematuria (12-15 RBCs/hpf), trace proteinuria, and a small number of WBCs (2-5 WBCs/hpf). These findings suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to ischemic damage from the initial hypovolemic shock. The question asks for an additional finding expected on urinalysis, which requires identifying the characteristic urinary sediment associated with ischemic AKI.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of the Options:\n\n#### **A. WBC casts**\n- **Analysis**: WBC casts are typically associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis or pyelonephritis. These conditions are inflammatory in nature and often accompanied by significant pyuria and leukocyturia. This patient has only 2-5 WBCs/hpf in the urinalysis, which is not consistent with a primary inflammatory or infectious process.\n- **Strengths**: WBC casts would point to an inflammatory kidney process, but this is not supported by the clinical context.\n- **Weaknesses**: There is no evidence of infection (e.g., fever, flank pain) or significant leukocyturia, making WBC casts unlikely in this case.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. RBC casts**\n- **Analysis**: RBC casts are a hallmark of glomerulonephritis, which involves glomerular inflammation and damage. Glomerulonephritis often presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and possibly hypertension. However, this patient\u2019s clinical presentation (trauma, hypovolemic shock, and ischemic AKI) does not suggest glomerular disease.\n- **Strengths**: The presence of hematuria might initially suggest RBC casts, but the clinical context does not support glomerular pathology.\n- **Weaknesses**: Hematuria in this patient is more likely due to ischemic tubular injury or trauma rather than glomerular disease. RBC casts are therefore unlikely.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Muddy brown casts**\n- **Analysis**: Muddy brown casts (granular casts) are characteristic of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is the most common cause of intrinsic AKI following ischemic or nephrotoxic injury. This patient\u2019s clinical presentation (hypovolemic shock, oliguria, and mild proteinuria) strongly suggests ischemic ATN as the cause of AKI. Granular casts are formed from necrotic tubular epithelial cells and are a hallmark finding in ATN.\n- **Strengths**: Fits perfectly with the clinical context of ischemic AKI secondary to hypovolemic shock.\n- **Weaknesses**: None; this is the most likely finding.\n- **Conclusion**: Most likely.\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Fatty casts**\n- **Analysis**: Fatty casts are typically seen in nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, and edema. This patient has only trace proteinuria and no other findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome.\n- **Strengths**: None; does not fit the clinical picture.\n- **Weaknesses**: Fatty casts are associated with nephrotic syndrome, which is not relevant to this case.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation, including hypovolemic shock, oliguria, and urinalysis findings, is most consistent with ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Additionally, the clinical presentation does not suggest nephrotic syndrome.\n- **Strengths**: Specific for nephrotic syndrome.\n- **Weaknesses**: Does not fit the clinical scenario or urinalysis findings.\n- **Conclusion**: Unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **C. Muddy brown casts**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation, including a history of hemorrhagic shock, oliguria, and hematuria, is consistent with **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)** due to ischemic injury. ATN results in the formation of **muddy brown casts**, which are composed of necrotic tubular epithelial cells and debris. These casts are a hallmark of ATN and are expected in this case.\n\nKey points supporting this conclusion:\n1. **Hemorrhagic shock** led to renal hypoperfusion and ischemia.\n2. **Oliguria** indicates impaired renal function.\n3. **Urinalysis findings** (hematuria and trace protein) are consistent with tubular injury.\n4. **Muddy brown casts** are the classic finding in ATN, which is the most likely diagnosis here.\n\nThus, the additional finding expected on urinalysis is **muddy brown casts**."}

WBC casts are unlikely in ischemic AKI.\n- **Conclusion:** Unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n**B. RBC casts:**\n- **Explanation:** RBC casts are indicative of **glomerulonephritis**, which involves inflammation of the glomeruli and is usually associated with significant proteinuria, hematuria, and dysmorphic RBCs.\n- **Relevance to Case:** The patient\u2019s urinalysis does show hematuria, but there is no mention of dysmorphic RBCs or significant proteinuria, and the clinical history does not suggest glomerulonephritis. The AKI is more likely ischemic in nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n**C. Muddy brown casts:**\n- **Explanation:** Muddy brown casts (granular casts) are pathognomonic for **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**, which is the most common cause of AKI in the setting of ischemia or nephrotoxic injury.\n- **Relevance to Case:** The patient\u2019s initial hypotension and hypoperfusion are classic triggers for ischemic ATN. The oliguria and urinalysis findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Muddy brown casts are expected in this scenario.\n- **Conclusion:** Most likely the correct answer.\n\n**D. Fatty casts:**\n- **Explanation:** Fatty casts are seen in **nephrotic syndrome**, a condition characterized by heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, and edema.\n- **Relevance to Case:** This patient does not have significant proteinuria or any features of nephrotic syndrome. Fatty casts are irrelevant in this context.\n- **Conclusion:** Unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Application of Relevant Principles:**\n- **Mechanism of AKI:** The patient likely developed ischemic AKI due to prolonged hypoperfusion during hemorrhagic shock. The renal tubular cells are highly sensitive to ischemia, leading to acute tubular necrosis.\n- **Urinalysis in ATN:** The hallmark of ATN is the presence of muddy brown granular casts, which are formed by the sloughing off of necrotic tubular epithelial cells. This finding is diagnostic in the appropriate clinical context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C. Muddy brown casts**\n\n**Rationale:** The patient\u2019s clinical history of hemorrhagic shock, oliguria, and urinalysis findings are most consistent with ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Muddy brown casts are the characteristic urinalysis finding in ATN, making this the correct answer."}
