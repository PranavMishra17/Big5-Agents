Carbon dioxide (CO2):**\n- **Strengths:** \n  - Carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas contributing to human-induced climate change. It accounts for the majority of emissions from human activities, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation.\n  - CO2 has a long atmospheric lifetime (ranging from decades to centuries), meaning its effects persist for a long time, making it a dominant driver of global warming.\n  - Scientific consensus, such as reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), highlights CO2 as the primary greenhouse gas responsible for anthropogenic climate change.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - While it is the primary driver, CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Methane, nitrous oxide, and others also play roles, though to a lesser degree.\n\n#### **B. Methane (CH4):**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a much higher global warming potential (GWP) than CO2 over a 20-year period (approximately 84-87 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2).\n  - It is released from sources such as agriculture (e.g., livestock), landfills, and fossil fuel extraction.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime (around 12 years) compared to CO2. While it is impactful in the short term, its cumulative contribution to long-term climate change is less significant than CO2.\n  - Methane emissions are smaller in magnitude compared to CO2 emissions, making it a secondary contributor to anthropogenic climate change.\n\n#### **C. Water vapor (H2O):**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and plays a critical role in the Earth's natural greenhouse effect.\n  - It amplifies warming through feedback mechanisms (e.g., warmer air holds more water vapor, which in turn traps more heat).\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Water vapor is not directly emitted by human activities in significant amounts. Its concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by temperature, making it a feedback mechanism rather than a direct driver of anthropogenic climate change.\n  - It is not considered a primary greenhouse gas in the context of human-induced climate change.\n\n#### **D. Nitrous oxide (N2O):**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas with a GWP approximately 298 times that of CO2 over a 100-year period.\n  - It is emitted from agricultural activities (e.g., fertilizer use), industrial processes, and combustion of fossil fuels and biomass.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - While impactful, nitrous oxide emissions are much smaller in magnitude compared to CO2 emissions, making it a less significant contributor to anthropogenic climate change.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\n- **Radiative Forcing:** Carbon dioxide has the largest radiative forcing effect among human-emitted greenhouse gases, meaning it contributes the most to changes in the Earth's energy balance.\n- **Emission Magnitude and Persistence:** CO2 is emitted in the largest quantities and remains in the atmosphere for centuries, making its cumulative impact on climate change far greater than that of other greenhouse gases.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe correct answer is **A. Carbon dioxide (CO2)**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for human-induced climate change due to its large-scale emissions from human activities, long atmospheric lifetime, and significant contribution to radiative forcing. While other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are also important, their contributions are secondary to CO2 in terms of both magnitude and long-term impact. Water vapor, though abundant, acts as a feedback mechanism rather than a direct driver of anthropogenic climate change."}
