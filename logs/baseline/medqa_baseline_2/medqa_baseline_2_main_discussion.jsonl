His blood pressure readings and lipid panel indicate that he is at elevated risk for cardiovascular events. He has already been started on lisinopril for hypertension, and lifestyle modifications (exercise and diet) have been advised. The next step is to determine which medication should be added to address his cardiovascular risk profile.\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Hypertension**: Blood pressure readings (150/90 and 140/90) indicate stage 2 hypertension. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is appropriate as initial therapy.\n2. **Dyslipidemia**:\n   - Total cholesterol: 250 mg/dL (elevated, desirable <200 mg/dL).\n   - LDL-cholesterol: 186 mg/dL (very high, optimal <100 mg/dL, or <70 mg/dL for high-risk patients).\n   - HDL-cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (low, desirable \u226540 mg/dL for men).\n   - Triglycerides: 250 mg/dL (elevated, normal <150 mg/dL).\n3. **Cardiovascular Risk**: His lipid profile and family history place him at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Management should focus on aggressive lipid-lowering therapy to reduce this risk.\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of Options:\n#### **A. Atorvastatin**\n- **Mechanism**: Atorvastatin is a high-potency statin that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing LDL cholesterol significantly and offering cardiovascular protection.\n- **Evidence**: Statins are first-line therapy for patients with elevated LDL cholesterol, especially in high-risk individuals (e.g., those with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history of premature ASCVD). Clinical trials (e.g., ASCOT-LLA, JUPITER) have shown that statins reduce cardiovascular events and mortality.\n- **Strengths**: \n  - Effectively lowers LDL cholesterol.\n  - Provides pleiotropic benefits (e.g., anti-inflammatory effects, plaque stabilization).\n  - Recommended by guidelines (e.g., ACC/AHA) for primary prevention in high-risk patients.\n- **Weaknesses**: May increase the risk of statin-associated side effects (e.g., myopathy, liver enzyme elevation), but these risks are generally outweighed by the benefits.\n\n#### **B. Niacin**\n- **Mechanism**: Niacin (vitamin B3) increases HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.\n- **Evidence**: While niacin can improve lipid profiles, recent clinical trials (e.g., AIM-HIGH, HPS2-THRIVE) have not shown significant reductions in cardiovascular events when added to statin therapy. Its role in primary prevention is limited.\n- **Strengths**: Raises HDL cholesterol, which is low in this patient.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - Associated with significant side effects (e.g., flushing, hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity).\n  - No proven cardiovascular benefit in contemporary practice.\n\n#### **C. Gemfibrozil**\n- **Mechanism**: Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that primarily reduces triglycerides and modestly increases HDL cholesterol.\n- **Evidence**: Fibrates are typically reserved for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides >500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. They are not first-line agents for cardiovascular risk reduction.\n- **Strengths**: Reduces triglycerides, which are elevated in this patient.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - Minimal effect on LDL cholesterol.\n  - Increased risk of myopathy when combined with statins.\n  - Limited evidence for reducing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n#### **D. Orlistat**\n- **Mechanism**: Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor used for weight loss by reducing fat absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n- **Evidence**: While weight loss can improve lipid profiles and blood pressure, this patient does not have obesity, and his lipid abnormalities are unlikely to be managed effectively by weight loss alone.\n- **Strengths**: Promotes weight loss, which can indirectly improve cardiovascular risk factors.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - No direct lipid-lowering effects.\n  - Not indicated for this patient, who is not obese.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThe best option is **A. Atorvastatin**.\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. The patient has high LDL cholesterol (186 mg/dL), which is a primary target for lipid-lowering therapy. Statins, particularly atorvastatin, are the first-line treatment for reducing LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk.\n2. His high cardiovascular risk (due to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history) justifies aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with a high-potency statin.\n3. Atorvastatin has strong evidence for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk patients.\n\n#### Rejection of Other Options:\n- **Niacin** (B): Limited evidence for cardiovascular benefit and higher side effect profile.\n- **Gemfibrozil** (C): Primarily for severe hypertriglyceridemia; minimal LDL-lowering effect.\n- **Orlistat** (D): Not relevant for this patient's lipid abnormalities or cardiovascular risk.\n\n### Final Answer: **A. Atorvastatin**"}

In addition to hypertension, the patient has significant dyslipidemia, as evidenced by his lab results:\n\n- **Total cholesterol**: 250 mg/dL (elevated; normal <200 mg/dL)\n- **HDL cholesterol**: 35 mg/dL (low; normal >40 mg/dL)\n- **LDL cholesterol**: 186 mg/dL (very high; normal <100 mg/dL for high-risk patients)\n- **Triglycerides**: 250 mg/dL (elevated; normal <150 mg/dL)\n\nThe patient also has a family history of premature cardiovascular disease (father died of a heart attack at 61 years of age). His cardiovascular risk is high due to the combination of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history, so aggressive management of his dyslipidemia is warranted to reduce his risk of future cardiovascular events.\n\nThe question asks which medication should be **added** to his current regimen. Let us evaluate the options:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Atorvastatin**\n- **Mechanism**: Atorvastatin is a statin, a class of drugs that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Statins are the first-line treatment for dyslipidemia, particularly for lowering LDL cholesterol.\n- **Evidence**: Statins have robust evidence in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high cardiovascular risk. This patient, with his high LDL cholesterol and family history of premature cardiovascular disease, is a clear candidate for statin therapy.\n- **Strengths**: Atorvastatin would effectively lower LDL cholesterol and potentially triglycerides while also stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and reducing inflammation.\n- **Weaknesses**: No significant weaknesses in this context. Atorvastatin is well-tolerated and highly effective for this patient\u2019s profile.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Niacin**\n- **Mechanism**: Niacin (vitamin B3) increases HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides. It also has modest effects on lowering LDL cholesterol.\n- **Evidence**: While niacin can improve lipid profiles, clinical trials have not shown significant cardiovascular benefit when added to statin therapy. It is not first-line therapy for dyslipidemia and is generally reserved for specific cases (e.g., severe hypertriglyceridemia or statin intolerance).\n- **Strengths**: Niacin could help raise this patient\u2019s low HDL cholesterol and lower his triglycerides.\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient\u2019s primary lipid abnormality is his very high LDL cholesterol, which niacin does not address as effectively as statins. Additionally, niacin is associated with side effects such as flushing, gastrointestinal upset, and potential hepatotoxicity, making it less favorable.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Gemfibrozil**\n- **Mechanism**: Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, a class of drugs that primarily lowers triglycerides by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-\u03b1), which increases lipoprotein lipase activity.\n- **Evidence**: Fibrates are primarily used for severe hypertriglyceridemia to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. They are not first-line therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction and have minimal impact on LDL cholesterol.\n- **Strengths**: Gemfibrozil could lower this patient\u2019s elevated triglycerides.\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient\u2019s primary lipid concern is his high LDL cholesterol, which gemfibrozil does not address effectively. Furthermore, fibrates are not as well-supported by evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction compared to statins. Combining gemfibrozil with a statin (if prescribed later) increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Orlistat**\n- **Mechanism**: Orlistat is a weight-loss medication that works by inhibiting gastrointestinal lipase, reducing fat absorption in the intestines.\n- **Evidence**: Orlistat is used for obesity management, not for dyslipidemia or cardiovascular risk reduction. This patient is not noted to have obesity or a BMI that would warrant weight-loss pharmacotherapy.\n- **Strengths**: Minimal, as this patient\u2019s primary concerns are hypertension and dyslipidemia, not weight loss.\n- **Weaknesses**: Orlistat does not address the patient\u2019s dyslipidemia or cardiovascular risk. Its use here would be inappropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation**\nThe patient is at high cardiovascular risk due to his hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history of premature cardiovascular disease. The primary target for therapy is his **elevated LDL cholesterol**, which is best addressed with a statin such as atorvastatin. Statins are the cornerstone of lipid management in high-risk patients and have the strongest evidence for reducing cardiovascular events.\n\n- **Correct Answer: A. Atorvastatin**\n\n### Rationale for Selecting Atorvastatin:\n1. **High LDL Cholesterol**: The patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol is very high (186 mg/dL), far above the target (<100 mg/dL for high-risk patients or <70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients).\n2. **Evidence-Based Therapy**: Statins have robust evidence for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients.\n3. **Comprehensive Lipid Control**: Atorvastatin will lower LDL cholesterol and may also reduce triglycerides modestly.\n4. **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction**: This patient\u2019s family history of premature cardiovascular disease and hypertension places him at high risk, making statin therapy essential.\n\nNiacin, gemfibrozil, and orlistat are less effective and less appropriate for this patient\u2019s clinical profile."}

He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease (his father died of a heart attack at 61). These findings place him at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While he has been started on lisinopril for hypertension, his lipid profile requires further intervention to mitigate his cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe task is to determine which medication should be added to his regimen to address his dyslipidemia or cardiovascular risk.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Evaluation of the Options:\n\n#### **A. Atorvastatin**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Atorvastatin is a statin, a first-line therapy for dyslipidemia, particularly for lowering LDL cholesterol. \n  - Statins have robust evidence for reducing cardiovascular events in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol and high ASCVD risk (as is the case here).\n  - Atorvastatin will effectively lower LDL cholesterol, reduce total cholesterol, and provide modest reductions in triglycerides. It may also slightly increase HDL cholesterol.\n  - Statins are particularly indicated in patients with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease and multiple risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia).\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Statins may cause side effects such as myopathy or liver enzyme elevations, but these are generally rare and manageable.\n\n#### **B. Niacin**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Niacin (vitamin B3) can increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides, which could be beneficial for this patient.\n  - It also has a modest effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Niacin is not considered first-line therapy for dyslipidemia due to limited evidence of cardiovascular benefit compared to statins.\n  - It is associated with significant side effects, including flushing, gastrointestinal upset, and potential hepatotoxicity.\n  - Current guidelines recommend against routine use of niacin in most patients because its risks often outweigh its benefits.\n\n#### **C. Gemfibrozil**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, which is effective at lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol.\n  - It could address this patient\u2019s elevated triglycerides (250 mg/dL).\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Fibrates are not first-line therapy for dyslipidemia unless triglycerides are extremely high (>500 mg/dL) and there is a risk of pancreatitis.\n  - Gemfibrozil has minimal impact on LDL cholesterol, which is the primary target for therapy in this patient.\n  - Co-administration of fibrates with statins (if a statin were later added) increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.\n\n#### **D. Orlistat**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Orlistat is a weight-loss medication that inhibits fat absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. It could be useful for patients with obesity and dyslipidemia.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - This patient is not described as obese, so Orlistat is not indicated.\n  - Orlistat does not directly target LDL cholesterol or triglycerides and has no proven cardiovascular benefit.\n  - It can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\n\n1. **ASCVD Risk Reduction:** This patient\u2019s elevated LDL cholesterol (186 mg/dL) is a major driver of his cardiovascular risk. Statins are the cornerstone of therapy for LDL reduction and ASCVD prevention.\n2. **Guideline-Based Therapy:** Current guidelines recommend high-intensity statins (e.g., atorvastatin) for patients with LDL cholesterol \u2265190 mg/dL or those with high ASCVD risk.\n3. **Therapeutic Prioritization:** While triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are important, LDL cholesterol is the primary target for therapy in this patient. Addressing LDL will also have secondary benefits on triglycerides and HDL.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\n\nThe correct answer is **A. Atorvastatin**.\n\n#### Rationale:\n- Atorvastatin is the most evidence-based and appropriate choice for this patient because it directly addresses his elevated LDL cholesterol and high ASCVD risk.\n- Statins have been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patients, such as this one.\n- The patient\u2019s lipid profile and family history strongly indicate the need for aggressive LDL-lowering therapy, which atorvastatin can provide.\n- Other options (Niacin, Gemfibrozil, Orlistat) are either not first-line therapies, lack significant cardiovascular benefit, or are not relevant to this patient\u2019s condition.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**A.

However, given his lipid profile and cardiovascular risk, additional pharmacological management of dyslipidemia is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of the Options\n\n#### **Option A: Atorvastatin**\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Atorvastatin is a statin, a first-line medication for lowering LDL cholesterol. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis and increasing LDL receptor activity, leading to decreased LDL levels.\n- **Indication**: This patient has very high LDL cholesterol (186 mg/dL), and statins are the cornerstone of therapy for LDL reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction. Atorvastatin also has pleiotropic effects, such as improving endothelial function and reducing inflammation, which further decrease cardiovascular risk.\n- **Strengths**: Statins are supported by robust evidence for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), especially in patients with high LDL and multiple risk factors.\n- **Weaknesses**: Potential side effects include myopathy and elevated liver enzymes, but these risks are relatively low compared to the benefits.\n\n#### **Option B: Niacin**\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Niacin (vitamin B3) reduces triglycerides and increases HDL cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic production of VLDL and promoting HDL synthesis.\n- **Indication**: Niacin could theoretically help this patient\u2019s low HDL (35 mg/dL) and elevated triglycerides (250 mg/dL).\n- **Strengths**: Niacin is effective at improving lipid profiles (HDL and triglycerides) but less effective for LDL reduction compared to statins.\n- **Weaknesses**: Niacin has fallen out of favor due to side effects (flushing, hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) and lack of evidence for reducing cardiovascular events in large trials.\n\n#### **Option C: Gemfibrozil**\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that primarily reduces triglycerides by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-\u03b1), which increases lipoprotein lipase activity.\n- **Indication**: This patient has elevated triglycerides (250 mg/dL), which fibrates are effective at lowering. However, fibrates are not first-line for LDL reduction.\n- **Strengths**: Gemfibrozil is useful for severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of pancreatitis.\n- **Weaknesses**: Fibrates do not significantly reduce cardiovascular events in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia and are not as effective as statins for LDL reduction. They can also increase the risk of myopathy when used with statins.\n\n#### **Option D: Orlistat**\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor that reduces dietary fat absorption, leading to weight loss.\n- **Indication**: Orlistat is primarily indicated for obesity management, not dyslipidemia or hypertension.\n- **Strengths**: Weight loss can improve lipid profiles and blood pressure indirectly.\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient is not described as obese, and his lipid abnormalities require direct pharmacological intervention rather than weight loss alone. Orlistat does not specifically target LDL cholesterol.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale\n\nThe best option for this patient is **A. Atorvastatin**.\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. **Primary Indication**: The patient has very high LDL cholesterol (186 mg/dL), which is the primary target for cardiovascular risk reduction. Statins are the first-line therapy for lowering LDL cholesterol and preventing ASCVD events.\n2. **Evidence**: Large clinical trials (e.g., ASCOT, JUPITER) have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with multiple risk factors like this man.\n3. **Additional Benefits**: Atorvastatin may also modestly reduce triglycerides and improve endothelial function, addressing other aspects of his dyslipidemia.\n4. **Risk-Benefit Ratio**: The benefits of statins in this context far outweigh the risks, and they are well-tolerated in most patients.\n\n#### Why Not Other Options?\n- **Niacin**: While it improves HDL and triglycerides, it lacks evidence for cardiovascular event reduction and has significant side effects.\n- **Gemfibrozil**: Effective for triglycerides but not LDL. Statins are preferred for cardiovascular risk reduction.\n- **Orlistat**: Not indicated for dyslipidemia in the absence of obesity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**A. Atorvastatin**"}

He has elevated blood pressure, which has been confirmed by home monitoring, and has been started on lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor). His lipid profile reveals significant abnormalities:\n- **Total cholesterol:** 250 mg/dL (high)\n- **HDL:** 35 mg/dL (low, indicating poor \"good cholesterol\")\n- **LDL:** 186 mg/dL (very high, contributing to cardiovascular risk)\n- **Triglycerides:** 250 mg/dL (high)\n\nAdditionally, his family history of hypertension and his father's death from a heart attack at 61 years old significantly increases his cardiovascular risk. His fasting glucose and renal function are normal, ruling out diabetes or renal impairment as immediate concerns.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce his cardiovascular risk through lipid management in addition to blood pressure control. Let us analyze the options for the next medication to be added:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Atorvastatin**\n- **Strengths:** Statins like atorvastatin are first-line therapy for managing high LDL cholesterol. They reduce LDL levels effectively and have been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes. Given this patient's LDL of 186 mg/dL, which is well above the target range (<100 mg/dL for high-risk individuals), atorvastatin is strongly indicated.\n- **Weaknesses:** Statins primarily target LDL cholesterol and have modest effects on triglycerides. However, this patient's triglycerides (250 mg/dL) are elevated but not in the extreme range (>500 mg/dL), so statin therapy is still appropriate as the initial lipid-lowering agent.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B: Niacin**\n- **Strengths:** Niacin can increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides, which are both abnormal in this patient. It is particularly useful for patients with mixed dyslipidemia (high LDL, low HDL, and high triglycerides).\n- **Weaknesses:** Niacin is not considered first-line therapy for LDL reduction and has limited evidence for reducing cardiovascular events compared to statins. Additionally, niacin is associated with side effects like flushing, pruritus, and potential worsening of glucose control, which may complicate long-term adherence.\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Gemfibrozil**\n- **Strengths:** Gemfibrozil (a fibrate) is effective in lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol. It would be beneficial for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient does not have extreme triglyceride levels. Furthermore, fibrates are less effective than statins for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk. Combining fibrates with statins can increase the risk of myopathy, so gemfibrozil is not the best choice here.\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Orlistat**\n- **Strengths:** Orlistat is a weight-loss medication that inhibits fat absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. It may improve lipid profiles indirectly by promoting weight loss in obese patients.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient\u2019s BMI and weight are not mentioned, so obesity is not identified as a contributing factor. Orlistat is not indicated for primary lipid management and would not address the patient\u2019s high LDL cholesterol directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation and Rationale**\nThe patient\u2019s primary lipid abnormality is **very high LDL cholesterol**, which places him at significant risk for future cardiovascular events. Statins, specifically **atorvastatin**, are the most effective and evidence-based therapy for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk. While his triglycerides are elevated, they are not high enough to warrant fibrates or niacin as first-line therapy. Orlistat is not relevant to his case.\n\n### **Correct Answer: A. Atorvastatin**\nAdding atorvastatin to this patient\u2019s regimen will address his most pressing lipid abnormality (high LDL cholesterol) and significantly reduce his overall cardiovascular risk."}

His blood pressure remains elevated despite lifestyle recommendations and treatment with lisinopril. Additionally, his lipid panel shows significant abnormalities, including elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as low HDL cholesterol. His family history of premature cardiovascular disease (father's heart attack at 61) places him at higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The question asks which medication should be added to his regimen to address these concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option\n\n#### **A. Atorvastatin**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Atorvastatin is a high-potency statin that effectively lowers LDL cholesterol and reduces the risk of ASCVD events.\n  - This patient has an LDL cholesterol of 186 mg/dL, which is significantly elevated. Current guidelines recommend statin therapy for primary prevention in individuals with LDL \u2265 190 mg/dL or in those with elevated ASCVD risk.\n  - The patient has multiple risk factors for ASCVD, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.\n  - Statins also provide a modest reduction in triglycerides and may slightly increase HDL cholesterol, addressing multiple aspects of his dyslipidemia.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - None significant in this context; atorvastatin is well-supported by evidence for this patient's profile.\n\n#### **B. Niacin**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Niacin can increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides, which could be beneficial for this patient given his low HDL (35 mg/dL) and elevated triglycerides (250 mg/dL).\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Niacin is not a first-line therapy for dyslipidemia due to limited evidence of reducing ASCVD events when added to statin therapy.\n  - It has significant side effects, such as flushing, gastrointestinal distress, and potential hepatotoxicity.\n  - Statins are more effective and better tolerated for ASCVD risk reduction.\n\n#### **C. Gemfibrozil**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that effectively lowers triglycerides and increases HDL cholesterol.\n  - It could help address the patient's elevated triglycerides (250 mg/dL).\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - Fibrates are primarily used for hypertriglyceridemia when triglycerides are >500 mg/dL to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. This patient\u2019s triglycerides are elevated but not high enough to warrant fibrate therapy.\n  - Fibrates do not significantly lower LDL cholesterol, which is the primary target for ASCVD risk reduction.\n  - Combining fibrates with statins (if a statin is later added) increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.\n\n#### **D. Orlistat**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - Orlistat is a weight-loss medication that reduces dietary fat absorption. Weight loss can improve both hypertension and lipid profiles.\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - The patient does not have obesity or a history of difficulty with weight management. His BMI is not provided, but there is no indication that weight loss is a primary concern.\n  - Orlistat does not directly address LDL cholesterol or triglycerides and is not indicated for dyslipidemia management.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles\n1. **Primary Prevention of ASCVD:** This patient\u2019s elevated LDL cholesterol (186 mg/dL) and significant ASCVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history) necessitate aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. Statins are the cornerstone of therapy for LDL reduction and ASCVD risk reduction.\n2. **Targeting LDL Cholesterol:** LDL cholesterol is the primary target for therapy in dyslipidemia management. Atorvastatin is the most appropriate choice to achieve this goal.\n3. **Secondary Lipid Abnormalities:** While triglycerides and HDL are also abnormal, addressing LDL cholesterol with a statin is the first priority. Other therapies (e.g., fibrates or niacin) may be considered later if triglycerides remain severely elevated or HDL remains low despite statin therapy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection and Rationale\n**Correct Answer: A. Atorvastatin**\n\n- Atorvastatin directly addresses the patient\u2019s significantly elevated LDL cholesterol and provides additional cardiovascular protection by reducing ASCVD risk.\n- It is supported by robust evidence and guidelines as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in high-risk patients.\n- The other options (niacin, gemfibrozil, orlistat) are not as effective or appropriate in this context, given the patient\u2019s lipid profile and cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n"}
