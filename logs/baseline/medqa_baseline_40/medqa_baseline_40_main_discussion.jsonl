Denver has a lower atmospheric pressure, which results in reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia). The body adapts to hypoxia through various mechanisms, including changes in erythropoietin (EPO) levels, oxygen saturation, and plasma volume.\n\n---\n\n### Systematic Analysis of Each Option\n\n#### **Option A: Unchanged \u2193 unchanged**\n- **Erythropoietin level:** This option suggests no change in EPO levels. However, hypoxia at high altitude stimulates EPO production to increase red blood cell production for better oxygen delivery. Thus, \"unchanged\" is unlikely.\n- **O2 saturation:** A decrease in oxygen saturation is expected at high altitude due to reduced oxygen availability in the atmosphere. This part of the option is correct.\n- **Plasma volume:** Plasma volume typically remains unchanged in the short term (1 week). Significant changes in plasma volume (e.g., reduction due to diuresis) occur over a longer duration. This part is plausible.\n\n**Weakness:** EPO levels are unlikely to remain unchanged.  \n**Strength:** Correct prediction of decreased oxygen saturation.  \n**Conclusion:** This option is partially correct but fails to account for the expected increase in EPO.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option B: Unchanged unchanged \u2193**\n- **Erythropoietin level:** Again, this option suggests no change in EPO levels, which is inconsistent with the expected physiological response to hypoxia at high altitude.\n- **O2 saturation:** Suggests no change in oxygen saturation, which is incorrect. At high altitude, oxygen saturation decreases due to lower atmospheric oxygen.\n- **Plasma volume:** Suggests a decrease in plasma volume. While plasma volume may decrease due to diuresis over time, this typically occurs after prolonged exposure to high altitude, not within 1 week.\n\n**Weakness:** Incorrect predictions for EPO and oxygen saturation.  \n**Strength:** Correct prediction of plasma volume reduction, though timing is questionable.  \n**Conclusion:** This option is largely incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option C: \u2191 unchanged unchanged**\n- **Erythropoietin level:** Suggests an increase in EPO levels, which is consistent with the physiological response to hypoxia. This is correct.\n- **O2 saturation:** Suggests no change in oxygen saturation, which is incorrect. Oxygen saturation decreases at high altitude due to reduced oxygen availability.\n- **Plasma volume:** Suggests no change in plasma volume. This is plausible within the short-term timeframe of 1 week.\n\n**Weakness:** Incorrect prediction for oxygen saturation.  \n**Strength:** Correct prediction for EPO and plasma volume.  \n**Conclusion:** This option is partially correct, but it fails to account for decreased oxygen saturation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option D: \u2191 \u2193 unchanged**\n- **Erythropoietin level:** Suggests an increase in EPO levels, which is consistent with the physiological response to hypoxia. This is correct.\n- **O2 saturation:** Suggests a decrease in oxygen saturation, which is consistent with the reduced oxygen availability at high altitude. This is correct.\n- **Plasma volume:** Suggests no change in plasma volume. This is plausible within the short-term timeframe of 1 week.\n\n**Weakness:** None identified; all predictions are consistent with physiological responses.  \n**Strength:** Accurately accounts for increased EPO, decreased oxygen saturation, and unchanged plasma volume.  \n**Conclusion:** This option is fully correct based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Principles\n1. **Erythropoietin Response:** Hypoxia stimulates the release of erythropoietin from the kidneys to promote erythropoiesis to compensate for reduced oxygen availability.\n2. **Oxygen Saturation:** At high altitude, atmospheric oxygen is lower, leading to decreased oxygen saturation in the blood.\n3. **Plasma Volume:** Short-term exposure to high altitude does not significantly affect plasma volume. Longer-term exposure may lead to reductions due to diuresis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection: **Option D**\n### Rationale:\nOption D accurately predicts the physiological changes expected after 1 week of living at high altitude:\n1. **Erythropoietin level:** Increased due to hypoxia-induced stimulation.\n2. **O2 saturation:** Decreased due to reduced oxygen availability at high altitude.\n3. **Plasma volume:** Unchanged within the short-term timeframe.\n\nThis option aligns with established physiological principles and evidence."}

Denver is approximately 5,280 feet (1,609 meters) above sea level, which means there is lower atmospheric pressure and reduced oxygen availability compared to New York City. This change triggers adaptive responses in the body.\n\n### Physiological Principles:\n1. **Erythropoietin (EPO) Level**: Erythropoietin is a hormone produced primarily by the kidneys in response to hypoxia (low oxygen levels). At high altitude, the reduced oxygen availability stimulates increased production of erythropoietin to promote red blood cell production, enhancing oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n2. **Oxygen Saturation (O2 Saturation)**: Oxygen saturation refers to the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the blood that are bound to oxygen. At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases, leading to reduced oxygen saturation levels.\n\n3. **Plasma Volume**: Acute exposure to high altitude often results in a reduction in plasma volume due to fluid shifts and increased diuresis. This is part of the body's effort to concentrate red blood cells and improve oxygen delivery.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n#### Option A: **Unchanged \u2193 unchanged**\n- **Strengths**: This accounts for the decrease in oxygen saturation due to high altitude.\n- **Weaknesses**: Erythropoietin levels would not remain unchanged because the hypoxia at high altitude triggers an increase in erythropoietin production. Plasma volume is also unlikely to remain unchanged due to fluid shifts.\n\n#### Option B: **Unchanged unchanged \u2193**\n- **Strengths**: This accounts for the reduction in plasma volume, which is expected at high altitude.\n- **Weaknesses**: Erythropoietin levels would not remain unchanged because hypoxia stimulates its production. Oxygen saturation would also decrease due to the lower oxygen availability.\n\n#### Option C: **\u2191 unchanged unchanged**\n- **Strengths**: This correctly predicts the increase in erythropoietin levels due to hypoxia.\n- **Weaknesses**: Oxygen saturation would not remain unchanged at high altitude; it would decrease. Plasma volume would also not remain unchanged.\n\n#### Option D: **\u2191 \u2193 unchanged**\n- **Strengths**: This correctly accounts for the increase in erythropoietin levels due to hypoxia and the decrease in oxygen saturation caused by reduced oxygen availability at high altitude.\n- **Weaknesses**: Plasma volume is unlikely to remain unchanged; it typically decreases due to fluid shifts and diuresis.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**D. \u2191 \u2193 unchanged**\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen this woman moved to Denver (a high-altitude environment), her body would experience hypoxia due to the lower oxygen availability. This would stimulate her kidneys to produce more erythropoietin, increasing erythropoietin levels. Oxygen saturation would decrease because the partial pressure of oxygen is lower at high altitude. Although plasma volume often decreases at high altitude, this change typically occurs over a longer period (more than 1 week), so plasma volume may remain unchanged in the short term.\n\nThus, the most likely set of changes in her blood sample is **\u2191 (erythropoietin level), \u2193 (oxygen saturation), unchanged (plasma volume)**."}
