His arterial blood gas (ABG) values provide critical information to assess his acid-base status. Let us analyze each option systematically in light of his ABG values:\n\n**ABG Values Recap:**\n- **pH:** 7.52 (elevated, indicating alkalemia)\n- **PaCO2:** 28 mm Hg (low, consistent with respiratory alkalosis)\n- **HCO3-:** 21 mEq/L (slightly decreased, likely a compensatory response)\n- **PaO2:** 74 mm Hg (reduced, indicating hypoxemia)\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **A. Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths:** None. The patient's pH is elevated (7.52), which is outside the normal range (7.35\u20137.45). This alone rules out normal acid-base status.\n- **Weaknesses:** The elevated pH and abnormal PaCO2 and HCO3- clearly indicate an acid-base disturbance. This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **B. Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in HCO3- (<22 mEq/L) and a compensatory decrease in PaCO2. The patient's HCO3- is slightly decreased (21 mEq/L), which could superficially suggest metabolic acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** The pH is elevated (alkalemia), not decreased (acidemia), ruling out a primary metabolic acidosis. The low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) is not consistent with compensation for metabolic acidosis but rather a primary respiratory process. This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **C. Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in PaCO2 and a compensatory increase in HCO3-. This might seem plausible given the patient's pulmonary symptoms and hypoxemia.\n- **Weaknesses:** The patient's PaCO2 is low (28 mm Hg), not elevated, ruling out respiratory acidosis. Additionally, the pH is alkalemic, not acidemic. This option is incorrect.\n\n#### **D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a primary decrease in PaCO2, leading to an elevated pH (alkalemia), with a compensatory decrease in HCO3-. This matches the patient's ABG findings:\n  - pH: 7.52 (alkalemia)\n  - PaCO2: 28 mm Hg (low, consistent with hyperventilation)\n  - HCO3-: 21 mEq/L (slightly decreased, compensatory)\n- The patient's clinical presentation (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia) is consistent with hyperventilation due to sepsis or hypoxemia, which commonly leads to respiratory alkalosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** None. This option aligns perfectly with the ABG findings and clinical scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Principles:\n1. **Acid-base homeostasis:** The elevated pH (alkalemia) indicates either a primary respiratory or metabolic alkalosis. The low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) confirms a primary respiratory alkalosis.\n2. **Compensation:** The slightly decreased HCO3- (21 mEq/L) is an expected compensatory response to chronic or subacute respiratory alkalosis.\n3. **Clinical correlation:** The patient is likely hyperventilating due to hypoxemia or systemic inflammation from a suspected infectious process (e.g., pneumonia with sepsis), which is a common cause of respiratory alkalosis.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n**Rationale:** The patient's ABG values (elevated pH, decreased PaCO2, and compensatory decrease in HCO3-) are consistent with respiratory alkalosis. The clinical context of fever, tachypnea, and hypoxemia further supports this diagnosis."}

His arterial blood gas (ABG) results must be carefully interpreted to determine the acid-base disturbance. The key values provided are:\n\n- **Blood pH**: 7.52 (alkalosis, as normal pH is 7.35\u20137.45)\n- **PaCO2**: 28 mm Hg (low, indicating hyperventilation)\n- **HCO3-**: 21 mEq/L (mildly low, but not significantly contributing to the alkalosis)\n- **PaO2**: 74 mm Hg (low, indicating hypoxemia)\n\nThese findings indicate an alkalotic state with a primary respiratory component (low PaCO2). Let us systematically evaluate each option.\n\n---\n\n### Option A: **Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths**: None, as the pH is clearly elevated (7.52), which is outside the normal range (7.35\u20137.45). This rules out normal acid-base status.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH, PaCO2, and HCO3- are all abnormal, indicating an acid-base disturbance. This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Option B: **Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low HCO3- (usually <22 mEq/L) and a low pH (<7.35). This patient does have a slightly low HCO3- (21 mEq/L), which might suggest a compensatory response.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH is elevated (alkalosis), not low, which directly contradicts metabolic acidosis. Additionally, the low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg) points to a respiratory cause, not a primary metabolic disturbance. This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Option C: **Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a high PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg) and a low pH (<7.35). This might occur in conditions like hypoventilation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n- **Weaknesses**: This patient has a low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg), not high, and an elevated pH (7.52), not low. These findings are incompatible with respiratory acidosis. This option is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Option D: **Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by an elevated pH (>7.45) and a low PaCO2 (<35 mm Hg), as seen in hyperventilation. This patient\u2019s ABG findings (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg) are consistent with this diagnosis. The mildly low HCO3- (21 mEq/L) likely represents renal compensation for the respiratory alkalosis, which is common in cases of prolonged hyperventilation.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. The clinical picture of fever, hypoxemia, and hyperventilation (likely due to sepsis or pneumonia) supports this diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n1. **pH as the starting point**: An elevated pH indicates alkalosis. This immediately rules out metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.\n2. **PaCO2 as the next step**: A low PaCO2 indicates a respiratory cause for the alkalosis (respiratory alkalosis).\n3. **HCO3- adjustment**: The mildly low HCO3- is secondary and represents renal compensation for the primary respiratory alkalosis.\n4. **Clinical context**: The patient\u2019s presentation (fever, hypoxemia, and hyperventilation) aligns with respiratory alkalosis, likely due to sepsis or pneumonia.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer: **D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n### Rationale:\nThis patient\u2019s ABG findings (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg, HCO3- 21 mEq/L) are most consistent with **respiratory alkalosis**, as the elevated pH and low PaCO2 indicate hyperventilation as the primary disturbance. The mildly low HCO3- is a compensatory response. His clinical presentation of fever, hypoxemia, and tachypnea supports a diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis, likely secondary to an infectious process such as pneumonia or sepsis."}

His hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure, tachycardia) and improvement after fluid resuscitation suggest sepsis. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values are as follows:\n- **pH 7.52 (alkalotic)**\n- **PaCO2 28 mm Hg (low, indicating hyperventilation)**\n- **HCO3- 21 mEq/L (slightly decreased, but not enough to explain the alkalosis)**\n\nThese findings suggest an **alkalotic disturbance**, likely related to his respiratory status.\n\n#### Step 2: Systematic Analysis of Each Option\n**Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths**: This option would be correct if the patient's pH, PaCO2, and HCO3- were all within normal ranges.\n- **Weaknesses**: The pH is elevated (alkalosis), and PaCO2 is low, indicating hyperventilation. These findings clearly deviate from normal acid-base status. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low pH and low HCO3-. It can occur in sepsis due to lactic acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient\u2019s pH is **high**, not low, ruling out acidosis. While the HCO3- is slightly decreased, it is not the primary driver of the alkalosis. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH and high PaCO2, often due to hypoventilation (e.g., COPD exacerbation).\n- **Weaknesses**: The patient\u2019s pH is elevated (alkalosis), and PaCO2 is **low**, indicating hyperventilation rather than hypoventilation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: Respiratory alkalosis**\n- **Strengths**: Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a high pH and low PaCO2, often due to hyperventilation. This aligns perfectly with the patient\u2019s ABG findings: pH 7.52 (alkalosis) and PaCO2 28 mm Hg (low). The slightly decreased HCO3- is likely a compensatory response.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This option is consistent with the data provided.\n\n#### Step 3: Relevant Principles\nRespiratory alkalosis arises from increased respiratory rate (hyperventilation), which leads to excessive elimination of CO2. In this patient, hyperventilation is likely due to hypoxemia (PaO2 74 mm Hg) and systemic inflammation from pneumonia and sepsis. The slightly decreased HCO3- reflects renal compensation for the respiratory disturbance.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**D. Respiratory alkalosis**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient\u2019s ABG findings (pH 7.52, PaCO2 28 mm Hg, HCO3- 21 mEq/L) and clinical context (pneumonia, sepsis, hypoxemia) are consistent with **respiratory alkalosis**. Hyperventilation due to hypoxemia and systemic inflammation is the most likely cause of the acid-base disturbance."}

The next step is to determine whether the alkalosis is respiratory or metabolic.\n\n#### **Step 2: Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\n**Option A: Normal acid-base status**\n- **Strengths:** Normal acid-base status would mean pH is within the normal range (7.35\u20137.45), PaCO2 is within 35\u201345 mm Hg, and HCO3- is within 22\u201326 mEq/L.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient has a pH of 7.52 (alkalotic), PaCO2 of 28 mm Hg (low), and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L (slightly decreased). These values clearly indicate an acid-base disturbance. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: Metabolic acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low pH (<7.35) and low HCO3- (<22 mEq/L). It can occur in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis.\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient has an alkalotic pH (7.52), not an acidotic one. Although the HCO3- is slightly reduced, it is not low enough to suggest metabolic acidosis. The primary disturbance here is not metabolic acidosis but rather respiratory alkalosis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: Respiratory acidosis**\n- **Strengths:** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH (<7.35) and elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg), often due to hypoventilation (e.g., COPD exacerbation or drug overdose).\n- **Weaknesses:** This patient has an alkalotic pH (7.52) and a low PaCO2 (28 mm Hg), which indicates hyperventilation, not hypoventilation. Respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with the provided data.

PaCO2 reflects respiratory contributions, while HCO3- reflects metabolic contributions.\n2. **Compensation:** In respiratory alkalosis, the kidneys compensate by decreasing HCO3- levels to normalize pH. This patient\u2019s HCO3- is slightly reduced, consistent with compensation.\n3. **Clinical Context:** Fever, hypoxemia (PaO2 74 mm Hg), and tachypnea (hyperventilation) are consistent with respiratory alkalosis, likely triggered by an infectious process such as pneumonia.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Selection**\n**Correct Answer: D.
