To answer this, we need to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (duration of action) of the local anesthetics listed in the options.\n\n#### **1. Mepivacaine (Option A):**\n- **Mechanism:** Mepivacaine is an amide-type local anesthetic. It is commonly used for regional anesthesia and has an intermediate duration of action.\n- **Duration:** Its duration of action is longer than lidocaine but shorter than long-acting agents like bupivacaine or etidocaine. It is not the shortest-acting anesthetic among the options provided.\n- **Weakness:** Mepivacaine is not known for rapid metabolism or short duration compared to other agents like chloroprocaine.\n\n#### **2. Chloroprocaine (Option B):**\n- **Mechanism:** Chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic. Ester anesthetics are rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterases, leading to a short duration of action.\n- **Duration:** Chloroprocaine has one of the shortest durations of action among local anesthetics, typically lasting 30\u201360 minutes. This makes it ideal for procedures requiring brief anesthesia, such as incision and drainage of an abscess.\n- **Strength:** Its rapid metabolism and short duration make it the most likely correct answer for this question.\n\n#### **3. Lidocaine (Option C):**\n- **Mechanism:** Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic. It is widely used due to its intermediate duration of action and rapid onset.\n- **Duration:** Lidocaine typically lasts 1\u20132 hours when used for local infiltration. While it is shorter-acting than agents like bupivacaine or etidocaine, it is longer-acting than chloroprocaine.\n- **Weakness:** Lidocaine does not provide the shortest duration of analgesia among the options.\n\n#### **4. Etidocaine (Option D):**\n- **Mechanism:** Etidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a long duration of action. It is used for procedures requiring prolonged anesthesia.\n- **Duration:** Etidocaine has one of the longest durations of action among local anesthetics, lasting several hours. This makes it unsuitable for the scenario described.\n- **Weakness:** Its long duration of action clearly disqualifies it from being the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Principles:\n1. **Ester vs. Amide Metabolism:** Ester-type anesthetics (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized rapidly by plasma cholinesterases, leading to shorter durations compared to amide-type anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine), which are metabolized in the liver.\n2. **Clinical Context:** The procedure described (incision and drainage of an abscess) is brief and requires a short-acting anesthetic to minimize unnecessary prolonged analgesia.\n\n---\n\n### Selection:\n**Correct Answer: B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n#### **Rationale:**\n- Chloroprocaine provides the shortest duration of analgesia among the options due to its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases.\n- Its duration of action (30\u201360 minutes) is appropriate for a short procedure like incision and drainage.\n- The other options (mepivacaine, lidocaine, etidocaine) have longer durations of action, making them less suitable for this scenario."}

Its rapid metabolism makes it ideal for short procedures.\n- **Clinical Use:** Often used for epidural anesthesia and procedures requiring very short duration of analgesia.\n- **Strength:** Shortest duration of action among the listed options.\n- **Weakness:** Limited use in some settings due to its short duration, but ideal for situations requiring minimal analgesia.\n\n#### **C. Lidocaine**\n- **Mechanism:** Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a rapid onset and intermediate duration of action.\n- **Duration:** Lidocaine typically provides analgesia for 1\u20132 hours when administered subcutaneously.\n- **Clinical Use:** Commonly used for infiltration anesthesia, nerve blocks, and minor procedures. It is versatile and widely available.\n- **Weakness:** Its duration of action is longer than that of chloroprocaine, making it less suitable for situations requiring the shortest duration of analgesia.\n\n#### **D. Etidocaine**\n- **Mechanism:** Etidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic with a long duration of action.\n- **Duration:** Etidocaine provides prolonged analgesia, often lasting several hours.\n- **Clinical Use:** Used for procedures requiring extended duration of anesthesia.\n- **Weakness:** Its long duration makes it unsuitable for situations requiring short-term analgesia.\n\n---\n\n### Application of Relevant Principles:\n1. **Duration of Action:** The question specifically asks for the local anesthetic with the shortest duration of analgesia. This is determined by the pharmacokinetics of the drug, particularly its metabolism and elimination.\n2. **Type of Local Anesthetic:** Ester-type anesthetics (e.g., chloroprocaine) are metabolized faster than amide-type anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine), leading to shorter durations of action.\n3. **Clinical Context:** In the emergency department setting, short-acting anesthetics are often preferred for minor procedures like abscess drainage.\n\n---\n\n### Selection and Rationale:\nThe correct answer is **B. Chloroprocaine**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic with the shortest duration of action among the options provided. Its rapid metabolism by plasma esterases ensures that analgesia is brief, typically lasting 30\u201360 minutes, which is ideal for a short procedure like incision and drainage of an abscess.\n- Mepivacaine, lidocaine, and etidocaine all have longer durations of action, making them less suitable for this specific clinical scenario."}
