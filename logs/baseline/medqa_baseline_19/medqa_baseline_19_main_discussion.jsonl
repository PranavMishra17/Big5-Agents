Thus, pathology in the interventricular septum or LAD is unlikely to produce ST elevations in V5 and V6.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is inconsistent with the lateral wall ST elevations observed.\n\n#### **Option B: Lateral wall of left ventricle, left circumflex coronary artery**\n- **Strengths**: The lateral wall of the left ventricle is supplied by the **left circumflex (LCX)** artery. ST elevations in leads V5 and V6 are classic for lateral wall involvement, making this option anatomically and physiologically appropriate.\n- **Weaknesses**: None. This option aligns directly with the findings in leads V5 and V6.\n- **Conclusion**: This is the most likely correct answer.\n\n#### **Option C: Left atrium, left main coronary artery**\n- **Strengths**: The left main coronary artery supplies both the LAD and LCX, but the left atrium itself is not typically associated with ST elevations in V5 and V6.\n- **Weaknesses**: ST elevations in V5 and V6 do not correlate specifically with left atrial pathology. Additionally, left main coronary artery occlusion typically causes widespread ST elevations across multiple territories, not isolated lateral wall involvement.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is inconsistent with the findings.\n\n#### **Option D: Right ventricle, left main coronary artery**\n- **Strengths**: The right ventricle is supplied primarily by the **right coronary artery (RCA)**, which is implicated in inferior wall involvement (leads II, III, avF). However, this does not explain the ST elevations in V5 and V6.\n- **Weaknesses**: ST elevations in V5 and V6 are lateral leads, which are unrelated to right ventricular pathology. Additionally, the left main coronary artery does not supply the right ventricle.\n- **Conclusion**: This option is anatomically and physiologically inconsistent with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Selection:\n\n**Correct Answer: B. Lateral wall of left ventricle, left circumflex coronary artery**\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. **Electrocardiographic Evidence**: ST elevations in leads V5 and V6 are indicative of lateral wall involvement, which is supplied by the **left circumflex artery**.\n2. **Anatomical Correlation**: The lateral wall of the left ventricle corresponds directly to the lateral leads (V5, V6).\n3. **Exclusion of Other Options**: None of the other options adequately explain the ST elevations observed in V5 and V6.\n\nThus, the pathology most likely involves the **lateral wall of the left ventricle**, supplied by the **left circumflex coronary artery**."}

Lateral wall of left ventricle, left circumflex coronary artery**\n\n---\n\n### Rationale\nThe ECG findings of **ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, avF)** and **lateral leads (V5, V6)** localize the ischemia/infarction to the **inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle**. This pattern is most consistent with pathology in the **left circumflex coronary artery (LCX)**, which supplies the lateral wall and, in left-dominant circulation, may also supply the inferior wall.
