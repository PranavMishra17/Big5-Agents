Core needle biopsy**\n\n#### Rationale:\nAfter integrating the analyses from all team members, it is clear that the most appropriate next step in managing this patient is a **core needle biopsy**. The patient presents with a suspicious breast mass confirmed on both physical examination and mammography. Core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a tissue diagnosis, as it provides definitive histopathological information necessary for confirming malignancy and guiding subsequent management.\n\nOther options are either premature or inappropriate:\n- **Bone scan (A)**: Reserved for staging after a confirmed cancer diagnosis, particularly in cases of suspected metastasis.\n- **Measurement of serum CA 15\u20133 (B)**: Tumor markers are not diagnostic tools and lack sensitivity and specificity for initial evaluation of a breast mass.\n- **Mastectomy (C)**: Surgical intervention is inappropriate without first confirming the diagnosis through biopsy.\n\nThe consensus among all team members supports **core needle biopsy** as the most logical, evidence-based, and minimally invasive approach to establish a definitive diagnosis. This aligns with clinical guidelines and best practices for evaluating a suspicious breast mass."

Core needle biopsy**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights from my teammates, it is clear that the most appropriate next step in managing this patient is to confirm the diagnosis through tissue sampling. The patient's clinical presentation and mammographic findings strongly suggest malignancy, and a core needle biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a definitive histopathological diagnosis. This minimally invasive procedure provides critical information about tumor type, grade, and receptor status, which are essential for guiding subsequent management decisions.\n\nOther options, such as bone scan (Option A) and serum CA 15\u20133 measurement (Option B), are premature and irrelevant at this stage since the diagnosis of malignancy has not been confirmed. Proceeding directly to mastectomy (Option C) without a confirmed diagnosis would be inappropriate and bypass the necessary diagnostic step.\n\nThus, **D. Core needle biopsy** is the correct and evidence-based choice."

Core needle biopsy is the most appropriate next step in management because it is the gold standard for obtaining tissue samples in cases of suspected breast cancer.
