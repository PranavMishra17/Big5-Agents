It will be 16 times greater**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAll analyses, including my own and those of my teammates, converge on the conclusion that the expected change in resistance through the stenotic artery follows **Poiseuille's Law**, which states that resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. A 50% stenosis implies the radius is halved, leading to a \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\)-fold increase in resistance. This mathematical relationship is supported by clinical evidence and aligns with the patient's presentation of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) caused by the stenotic left internal carotid artery. Options A and B underestimate the increase in resistance, while option D is inconsistent with the basic principles of fluid dynamics. Therefore, **Option C** is the correct answer."

      "message": "**C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter analyzing the question and integrating insights from all perspectives, the correct answer remains **C**. This is based on the application of **Poiseuille's Law**, which states that resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius. A 50% stenosis reduces the radius by half, leading to a \\( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \\)-fold increase in resistance. This exponential relationship explains the significant impact of stenosis on blood flow and the clinical presentation of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in this patient. \n\nAll other options either underestimate the effect of stenosis or are inconsistent with the principles of fluid dynamics. Thus, **Option C** is the correct and evidence-based choice."

      "message": "**C. It will be 16 times greater**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights from teammates, the consensus is clear: the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery is most accurately described by **Poiseuille's Law**. A 50% stenosis reduces the radius of the artery to half its original size. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (\\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} \\)), halving the radius results in a \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)-fold increase in resistance.\n\nThis prediction aligns with both the mathematical principles of fluid dynamics and the clinical presentation of transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms due to reduced perfusion from the left internal carotid artery. All other options either underestimate the impact of stenosis or contradict established physiological principles. Therefore, **Option C** is the correct choice."

All analyses consistently applied **Poiseuille's Law**, which states that resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius (\\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} \\)). \n\nA 50% stenosis reduces the radius to half of its original size (\\( r \\to \\frac{r}{2} \\)), resulting in a **16-fold increase in resistance**:\n\\[\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^4} = 16R\n\\]\n\nThis exponential increase in resistance explains the transient ischemic symptoms experienced by the patient, as the stenotic left internal carotid artery (50% stenosis) caused reduced perfusion to the brain. The clinical presentation, mathematical principles, and exclusion of other options strongly support **Option C** as the correct choice."
