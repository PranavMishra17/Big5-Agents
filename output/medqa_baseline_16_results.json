Data is collected prospectively, making Option C the most accurate choice.  \n\nOptions A and D incorrectly categorize the study as retrospective or case-control, neither of which matches the prospective nature of the study.

The study involves enrolling participants based on their DM2 status and monitoring them over their lifetimes to observe the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data is collected prospectively as events unfold, which aligns with the characteristics of a prospective observational study.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because the study is not retrospective; it does not analyze past data but rather collects data forward in time.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because observational studies cannot establish causation, only associations.\n- **Option D** is incorrect because the study is not a case-control design, which would involve starting with cases (AD) and controls (non-AD) and looking retrospectively at exposures.\n\nThus, the most accurate and logical answer is **C: It is a prospective observational study.**"

      "message": "**Final Answer: C**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe study design involves enrolling participants based on their exposure status (DM2 vs. non-DM2) and monitoring them prospectively over their lifetimes to observe the development of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. This aligns perfectly with the definition of a prospective observational study, as data is collected forward in time, and outcomes are confirmed post-mortem. Observational studies like this can establish associations but cannot prove causation, ruling out Option B. Additionally, the study is not retrospective (Option A) or case-control (Option D), as it does not rely on past data or start with cases and controls. All team analyses unanimously support Option C as the correct choice."
