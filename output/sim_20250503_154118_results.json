The clinical features of **subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes**, combined with **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI**, **mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF**, and **focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG**, are characteristic of **limbic encephalitis** associated with anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n\nKey points supporting this conclusion:\n1. **MRI findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are hallmark features of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n2. **CSF findings**: Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis is consistent with the inflammatory process seen in anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n3. **EEG findings**: Focal slowing in the temporal regions aligns with limbic dysfunction.\n4. **Demographics and clinical presentation**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis typically occurs in middle-aged adults and presents with subacute cognitive and behavioral symptoms, fitting this patient's profile. Although more common in men, it can occur in women as well.\n\nOther options (anti-NMDA receptor, anti-GABA-B receptor, and anti-AMPA receptor antibodies) were systematically ruled out due to less characteristic clinical or radiological findings, or associations with malignancies or other syndromes not present in this case.\n\nThus, **anti-LGI1 antibodies (B)** are the most likely autoantibody associated with this patient's presentation."
