Among the options provided, **breastfeeding only** has been shown to modestly reduce the risk of developing pyloric stenosis compared to formula feeding. While breastfeeding does not entirely eliminate the risk, it is the most evidence-based intervention among the given choices.

Breastfeeding only**\n\n### Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation of the infant\u2014feeding difficulties, sour-smelling vomiting, lethargy, dehydration, and a palpable epigastric mass\u2014is consistent with **infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)**. IHPS is a multifactorial condition influenced by genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and feeding practices. Among the options provided, **breastfeeding** has been shown to modestly reduce the risk of developing IHPS compared to formula feeding. While breastfeeding does not completely eliminate the risk, it is associated with protective effects, likely due to differences in milk composition and feeding patterns.\n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) are either unrelated to the pathophysiology of IHPS or lack evidence supporting their role in prevention. Therefore, **Option B: Breastfeeding only** is the most evidence-based intervention to reduce the risk of IHPS."
