Lyme disease, caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*, is transmitted by Ixodes ticks and can progress to disseminated stages if untreated.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n- **Bell\u2019s palsy** is a well-documented neurological complication of untreated Lyme disease, particularly in the disseminated stage, making **B** the correct answer.\n- The other options (necrotizing fasciitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and mitral valve prolapse) are unrelated to Lyme disease and inconsistent with the clinical scenario.\n\nThus, the most accurate and evidence-based choice is **B. Bell\u2019s palsy**."

If untreated, Lyme disease can progress to disseminated stages, which frequently involve neurological complications such as **Bell\u2019s palsy** (facial nerve paralysis). Bell\u2019s palsy is a well-documented complication of untreated Lyme disease, making it the correct answer.\n\nThe other options\u2014necrotizing fasciitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and mitral valve prolapse\u2014are unrelated to Lyme disease and inconsistent with its progression or complications.

Bell\u2019s palsy**\n\n#### Rationale:\nThe patient presents with symptoms and findings consistent with **early Lyme disease**, including the hallmark **erythema migrans rash** and systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and neck stiffness. Her recent camping trip to Connecticut, an area endemic for Lyme disease, further supports this diagnosis. Lyme disease, if untreated, can progress to disseminated stages, leading to complications such as **Bell\u2019s palsy**, a well-documented neurological manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis.\n\nThe other options:\n- **A. Necrotizing fasciitis**: Unrelated to Lyme disease; caused by different bacteria and presents with distinct symptoms.\n- **C. Pseudomembranous colitis**: Associated with *Clostridioides difficile* infection, not Lyme disease.\n- **D. Mitral valve prolapse**: A structural heart condition unrelated to Lyme disease.\n\nBell\u2019s palsy is the most plausible complication of untreated Lyme disease, making **B** the correct answer."
