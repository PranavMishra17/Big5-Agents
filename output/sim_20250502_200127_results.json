The clinical presentation (subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes), **MRI findings** (bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities), **CSF analysis** (mild lymphocytic pleocytosis), and **EEG findings** (focal slowing in the temporal regions) are all hallmark features of **limbic encephalitis**, which is most commonly associated with **anti-LGI1 antibodies**.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Anti-LGI1 antibodies** are a well-recognized cause of autoimmune limbic encephalitis, particularly in middle-aged adults, and the clinical and radiological findings align perfectly with this condition.\n2. Other options (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor, anti-GABA-B receptor, and anti-AMPA receptor antibodies) are less likely due to differences in the typical clinical presentation, imaging findings, or associations with malignancies.\n\nAll team members independently arrived at the same conclusion, and the evidence overwhelmingly supports **anti-LGI1 antibodies** as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer: B.
