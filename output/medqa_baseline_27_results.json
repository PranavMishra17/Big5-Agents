Using the formula:\n\n\\[\nARR = \\text{Risk in control group} - \\text{Risk in treatment group}\n\\]\n\nThe calculated risks are:\n- Risk in the control group: \\( \\frac{30}{480} = 0.0625 \\, \\text{(6.25%)} \\)\n- Risk in the treatment group: \\( \\frac{13}{520} = 0.025 \\, \\text{(2.5%)} \\)\n\n\\[\nARR = 6.25\\% - 2.5\\% = 3.75\\%\n\\]\n\nThis matches **Option C (3.75%)**, which is the correct answer. All teammates' analyses confirm this conclusion, and the rationale is consistent with standard epidemiological principles."

Using the formula \\( ARR = Rc - Rt \\), the ARR is \\( 6.25\\% - 2.5\\% = 3.75\\% \\). This matches Option C, which is the correct answer. All other options either underestimate or overestimate the ARR, or confuse it with the risk in one group rather than the difference between groups."

The ARR was determined to be **3.75%**, which directly corresponds to Option C. This calculation adheres to standard epidemiological principles and accurately interprets the provided data. Therefore, Option C is the correct choice."
