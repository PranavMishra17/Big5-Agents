Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Rationale:\nAfter integrating the analyses provided by all team members, the consensus is clear: the clinical presentation of the 7-month-old boy strongly suggests **intussusception**, characterized by intermittent severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, bloody/mucous stool (\"currant jelly stool\"), and a palpable abdominal mass. \n\nAmong the diagnostic options:\n- **Peripheral blood culture (A)** and **Complete blood count with differential (C)** provide supportive information but are not diagnostic for intussusception.\n- **Kidney, ureter, bladder radiograph (B)** may provide indirect evidence but lacks the sensitivity and specificity to reliably diagnose intussusception.\n- **Abdominal ultrasound (D)** is the **gold standard** for diagnosing intussusception, offering high sensitivity and specificity, and directly visualizing hallmark findings like the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign.\"\n\nGiven the urgency of confirming the diagnosis to initiate prompt treatment, **abdominal ultrasound** is the most appropriate next diagnostic test."

Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n### Integrated Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation of the 7-month-old boy, including intermittent severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, \"currant jelly stool,\" and a palpable abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant, is highly suggestive of **intussusception**. This condition requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications like bowel ischemia and necrosis.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n- **Peripheral blood culture (A)** and **CBC with differential (C)** are ancillary tests that may provide supportive information but do not directly confirm intussusception. \n- **KUB radiograph (B)** can show indirect signs of bowel obstruction but is not as sensitive or specific as ultrasound for diagnosing intussusception.\n- **Abdominal ultrasound (D)** is the **gold standard** for diagnosing intussusception. It is non-invasive, widely available, and highly sensitive and specific for detecting the characteristic findings of intussusception, such as the \"target sign\" or \"donut sign.\"\n\nConsidering the urgency of the condition and the need for accurate and timely diagnosis, **abdominal ultrasound** is the most appropriate next diagnostic test. All team members agree on this conclusion, reinforcing the consensus that ultrasound is the optimal choice in this scenario."
