The boy's aggressive and disruptive behaviors, such as bullying, skipping classes, and smoking, are direct manifestations of his emotional turmoil following the family conflict (his father's departure and the discovery of his mother's affair). These actions align closely with the definition of acting out, where unresolved emotional conflicts are expressed through impulsive and socially inappropriate behaviors. The timeline and overt nature of his actions further support this conclusion. Other options, such as projection, passive aggression, and regression, do not adequately capture the externalized and confrontational nature of his behaviors."

      "message": "**Final Answer: A. Acting out**\n\n### **Rationale:**\nAfter integrating the analyses from all perspectives, the defense mechanism that best describes the boy's behavior is **acting out**. This conclusion is supported by the following points:\n\n1. **Behavioral Characteristics:** The boy's sudden shift from being a high-achieving, well-behaved student to engaging in disruptive, aggressive, and impulsive behaviors (bullying, skipping classes, smoking) aligns with the definition of acting out. These actions are overt and confrontational, serving as a direct expression of his emotional distress.\n\n2. **Timeline of Events:** The behavioral changes began shortly after the emotional upheaval caused by his father's departure and the discovery of his mother's affair. Acting out is a common defense mechanism in adolescents facing significant stressors, as they often lack the emotional tools to process their feelings in healthier ways.\n\n3. **Elimination of Other Options:**\n   - **Projection:** There is no evidence in the vignette that the boy is attributing his own feelings or impulses to others.\n   - **Passive aggression:** His actions are overtly aggressive and disruptive, not subtle or indirect, ruling out passive aggression.\n   - **Regression:** While regression involves reverting to earlier developmental behaviors, the boy's actions are not immature or childlike but rather rebellious and defiant, which fits better with acting out.\n\n4. **Consensus Across Analyses:** All team members agree that acting out is the most appropriate defense mechanism to describe the boy's behavior, given the direct and impulsive nature of his actions in response to emotional distress.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe boy's disruptive behaviors are best explained by the defense mechanism of **acting out**, making **A** the correct choice."
