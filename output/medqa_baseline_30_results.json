The neurologic findings\u2014weakness and sensory loss in the upper extremities, intact lower extremity function, and absent upper extremity reflexes\u2014strongly suggest spinal cord involvement. \n\n**MRI of the cervical spine without contrast** is the gold standard imaging modality for evaluating spinal cord injuries. It provides detailed visualization of soft tissue structures, including the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and ligaments, and can confirm the presence of spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, or compression. Other options, such as CT angiography, cervical myelography, and X-ray, are either inappropriate or insufficient for diagnosing central cord syndrome in this scenario.
