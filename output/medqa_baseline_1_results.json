Oral erythromycin**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating the analyses provided by all team members, the consensus strongly supports **oral erythromycin** as the best pharmacotherapy for this patient's underlying condition. The presentation of **mucoid ocular discharge, eyelid swelling, and systemic respiratory symptoms (cough, crackles, hyperinflation, and bilateral infiltrates)** is most consistent with **neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infection**, which requires systemic treatment. Oral erythromycin effectively treats both the conjunctivitis and pneumonia caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, addressing the systemic nature of the infection. While topical erythromycin or artificial tears would only provide localized relief, and intravenous acyclovir is inappropriate for this bacterial etiology, oral erythromycin remains the gold standard despite its small risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. Oral erythromycin**."

While topical erythromycin might treat the conjunctivitis, it is insufficient for the associated pneumonia. Artificial tears and intravenous acyclovir are inappropriate for this bacterial infection. \n\nThe risk of **infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)** associated with oral erythromycin is minimal compared to the need to treat a potentially life-threatening infection.
