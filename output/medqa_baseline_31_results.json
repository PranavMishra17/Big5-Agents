Cabergoline**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter analyzing the clinical scenario and integrating insights from my teammates, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is **Cabergoline**. The patient's symptoms of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, along with a negative pregnancy test and guaiac-negative nipple discharge, strongly suggest **hyperprolactinemia** as the underlying cause. Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, is the first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia. It works by directly inhibiting prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary, thereby addressing the root cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nOther options are either irrelevant (Tamoxifen, Carbidopa-Levodopa) or contraindicated (Haloperidol), as they do not address the endocrine etiology and may worsen the condition. Cabergoline is effective, well-tolerated, and specifically indicated for this condition, making it the correct choice."

Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, is the **first-line treatment** for this condition as it directly reduces prolactin secretion by stimulating dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary. This therapy is highly effective in resolving galactorrhea, restoring menstrual cycles, and addressing the underlying pathology, whether caused by a prolactinoma or other etiologies.\n\nOther options (Tamoxifen, Haloperidol, and Carbidopa-Levodopa) are either irrelevant or contraindicated in this scenario and do not address the endocrine dysfunction causing the patient's symptoms.
