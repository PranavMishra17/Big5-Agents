Here's why:\n\n1. **Erythropoietin Level (\u2191):**\n   - At high altitude, hypoxia (reduced oxygen availability) stimulates the kidneys to increase erythropoietin production. This response begins within hours to days of exposure and is well-documented.\n\n2. **Oxygen Saturation (\u2193):**\n   - The lower atmospheric oxygen at high altitude leads to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. This occurs immediately upon exposure to high altitude and is a hallmark of altitude adaptation.\n\n3. **Plasma Volume (unchanged):**\n   - While plasma volume may decrease due to diuresis and fluid shifts at high altitude, these changes typically take longer than 1 week to become significant. In the short term, plasma volume is likely to remain relatively unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption D accurately reflects the physiological changes expected in this scenario. It aligns with established principles of altitude physiology and the timeframe given in the question."

This choice is consistent with the physiological responses expected after moving to a high-altitude environment like Denver (5,280 feet above sea level).\n\n1. **Erythropoietin Level (\u2191)**: The hypoxia caused by reduced oxygen availability at high altitude stimulates the kidneys to produce more erythropoietin. This response begins within hours to days and is well-documented.\n\n2. **Oxygen Saturation (\u2193)**: At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is lower, leading to decreased oxygen saturation in the blood. This occurs immediately upon exposure to high altitude.\n\n3. **Plasma Volume (unchanged)**: While plasma volume may eventually decrease due to diuresis and fluid shifts, these changes are typically more pronounced after prolonged exposure (weeks). Within 1 week, plasma volume is likely to remain relatively unchanged.\n\nOption **D** aligns most closely with established physiological principles and the timeframe described in the question."
