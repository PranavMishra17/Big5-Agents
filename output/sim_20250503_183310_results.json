Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating the insights from all team members and my own analysis, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **anti-LGI1 antibody-associated encephalitis**. The clinical presentation of **subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes**, combined with **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI**, **mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF**, and **focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG**, is highly characteristic of **limbic encephalitis** caused by anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n\nKey supporting points for this choice:\n- **Anti-LGI1 encephalitis** is the most common autoimmune cause of limbic encephalitis in this patient\u2019s age group.\n- The MRI findings of **bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities** are a hallmark feature of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n- The absence of malignancy or prominent seizures makes **anti-GABA-B receptor** and **anti-AMPA receptor** encephalitis less likely.\n- The lack of broader neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as dyskinesias or autonomic instability, and the patient's age make **anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis** less probable.\n\nAll team members reached the same conclusion, reinforcing the reliability of this diagnosis. **Anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the best fit for this clinical scenario."

Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights from teammates (Neurologist, Radiologist, Psychiatrist, and Infectious Disease Specialist), it is clear that the clinical presentation, MRI findings, CSF analysis, and EEG changes strongly point to **limbic encephalitis**. Among the autoantibodies listed, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most strongly associated with this pattern. The patient\u2019s age (middle-aged adult), absence of malignancy, and lack of systemic symptoms further support this diagnosis over the other options. This conclusion is consistent across all perspectives provided."

Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation of **subacute memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes**, combined with the **MRI findings of bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities**, **mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF**, and **EEG showing focal slowing in the temporal regions**, is most consistent with **limbic encephalitis**. Among the autoantibodies listed, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most strongly associated with this specific pattern.\n\nKey factors supporting this conclusion:\n1. **MRI findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are a hallmark of limbic encephalitis and are strongly linked to anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n2. **Demographics**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is more common in middle-aged adults and does not typically require an underlying malignancy, unlike other options such as anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis.\n3. **Clinical features**: The absence of features like dyskinesias, autonomic instability, or a malignancy history makes other options (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor, anti-GABA-B receptor, or anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis) less likely.\n4. **Consistency across perspectives**: All team members, including the neurologist, immunologist, psychiatrist, and infectious disease specialist, agree that anti-LGI1 antibodies align best with the patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nThus, the most likely autoantibody associated with this clinical presentation is **anti-LGI1 antibodies**."

Among the options provided, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most strongly associated with this presentation.\n\nKey points supporting this conclusion:\n1. **Anti-LGI1 encephalitis** is a classic cause of limbic encephalitis, presenting with the exact constellation of symptoms and findings described in this case.\n2. The patient\u2019s age and the absence of malignancy or systemic features further align with anti-LGI1 encephalitis, as opposed to anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis, which are more often paraneoplastic.\n3. While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can present with some overlapping symptoms, its broader neuropsychiatric spectrum and lack of specific medial temporal lobe involvement on MRI make it less likely here.\n\nThus, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most likely autoantibody associated with this patient\u2019s presentation."
