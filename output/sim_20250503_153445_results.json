Other options (e.g., anti-GABA-B receptor or anti-AMPA receptor antibodies) are less likely due to their stronger associations with malignancy or older age demographics.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by consensus across all team analyses, which systematically excluded other options based on their clinical, imaging, and demographic inconsistencies. **Anti-LGI1 antibodies** are the most likely cause of this patient's autoimmune encephalitis."
