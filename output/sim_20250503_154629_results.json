Anti-LGI1 antibodies**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights from my teammates:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient\u2019s subacute onset of memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes over 3 weeks is highly suggestive of limbic encephalitis.\n2. **MRI Findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are classic for anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n3. **CSF and EEG Findings**: Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF and focal slowing in the temporal regions on EEG further support a diagnosis of limbic encephalitis.\n4. **Demographics**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is more common in middle-aged adults but can also occur in younger adults, making it the best match for this 32-year-old female.\n5. **Exclusion of Other Options**:\n   - **Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies**: Less likely due to the absence of hallmark features such as seizures, dyskinesias, or autonomic instability, and the MRI findings are not typical.\n   - **Anti-GABA-B receptor antibodies**: Less likely due to the patient\u2019s younger age and lack of a malignancy.\n   - **Anti-AMPA receptor antibodies**: Less likely due to its rarity and frequent association with malignancies, which are not mentioned in this case.\n\n### Consensus:\nThe clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings are most consistent with **anti-LGI1 encephalitis**, a common cause of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. This conclusion aligns with the analyses provided by teammates across different specialties."
