Among the listed options, **anti-LGI1 antibodies** are most strongly associated with this specific presentation.\n\nKey points supporting **anti-LGI1 antibodies**:\n1. **MRI findings**: Bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities are hallmark features of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n2. **CSF findings**: Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis is consistent with this diagnosis.\n3. **EEG findings**: Focal slowing in the temporal regions aligns well with limbic encephalitis caused by anti-LGI1 antibodies.\n4. **Clinical presentation**: Subacute onset of memory deficits, confusion, and behavioral changes perfectly matches the typical presentation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\n5. **Demographics**: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is commonly seen in middle-aged adults, which fits the patient's profile.\n\nOther options (anti-NMDA receptor, anti-GABA-B receptor, and anti-AMPA receptor antibodies) were systematically ruled out due to inconsistencies in the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, as well as demographic factors.
