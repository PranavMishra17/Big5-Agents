Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia**\n\n### Final Rationale:\nThe clinical presentation of the infant, including generalized hypotonia, characteristic facial features, hand anomalies, and the confirmed karyotype, is diagnostic of **Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)**. The additional mention of a **GATA1 gene mutation** is critical, as it is strongly associated with hematologic abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome. Specifically, GATA1 mutations predispose to **transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)**, a pre-leukemic condition that can progress to **acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL)**.\n\nWhile other conditions (e.g., celiac disease, congenital cataracts, endocardial cushion defects) are associated with Down syndrome, they are not linked to the GATA1 mutation. The focus of the question is on the condition most likely associated with this specific genetic mutation, making **A. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia** the most accurate and relevant answer."

The presence of a **GATA1 mutation** is highly specific and directly associated with hematologic abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome, particularly **acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL)**. GATA1 mutations lead to abnormal megakaryocyte and erythroid development, predisposing to transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and progression to AMKL. While other options (e.g., celiac disease, congenital cataracts, and endocardial cushion defects) are associated with Down syndrome, they are not linked to the GATA1 mutation, making **A.
