Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a well-recognized subtype of limbic encephalitis, typically presenting with these exact symptoms and imaging findings. It is most common in middle-aged adults but can also affect younger individuals, as in this case. The absence of malignancy or paraneoplastic features further supports anti-LGI1 encephalitis over other options like anti-GABA-B or anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis.\n\nAll team members consistently identified **anti-LGI1 antibodies** as the most likely diagnosis, and their analyses align with my initial assessment.
