Chloroprocaine**\n\n### Rationale:\nAfter integrating my analysis with the insights provided by my teammates, the consensus is clear: **Chloroprocaine** is the correct choice. \n\n- Chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anesthetic with the **shortest duration of analgesia** among the options, typically lasting **30\u201360 minutes**. This is due to its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterases, making it ideal for brief procedures like **incision and drainage of an abscess**.\n- The other options\u2014**Mepivacaine**, **Lidocaine**, and **Etidocaine**\u2014are all amide-type anesthetics with longer durations of action. While Lidocaine and Mepivacaine are shorter-acting than Etidocaine, they still do not match the brief duration of Chloroprocaine, which is specifically suited for the clinical scenario described. \n\nThus, **Option B: Chloroprocaine** is the most appropriate selection for this task."

      "message": "**Final Answer: B. Chloroprocaine**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAfter integrating the analyses from all perspectives, the consensus is that **Chloroprocaine** provides the shortest duration of analgesia among the options listed. As an ester-type local anesthetic, it is rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterases, resulting in a very short duration of action (approximately 30\u201360 minutes). This makes it ideal for brief procedures like the incision and drainage of an abscess, as described in the clinical scenario.  \n\nThe other options (Mepivacaine, Lidocaine, and Etidocaine) all have longer durations of action, making them less suitable for this specific case. Chloroprocaine's pharmacokinetic properties and clinical utility align perfectly with the requirements of the question."
