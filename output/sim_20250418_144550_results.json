CO2 has the highest total radiative forcing among anthropogenic greenhouse gases, making it the primary driver of the enhanced greenhouse effect.  \n\n4. **Scientific Consensus**:  \n   - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other authoritative scientific organizations consistently identify CO2 as the leading greenhouse gas responsible for human-induced climate change.  \n   - This conclusion is supported by robust evidence, including emissions data, atmospheric lifetimes, and radiative forcing metrics.  \n\n5. **Comparison with Other Options**:  \n   - **Methane (CH4)**: While methane is more potent on a per-molecule basis, its shorter atmospheric lifetime and lower overall emissions volume make its cumulative contribution smaller than that of CO2.  \n   - **Water vapor (H2O)**: Water vapor acts as a feedback mechanism rather than a primary driver. Its concentration is controlled by temperature changes initiated by other greenhouse gases like CO2.  \n   - **Nitrous oxide (N2O)**: Although nitrous oxide has a high global warming potential, its overall contribution to climate change is smaller due to its lower atmospheric concentration and emissions volume.  \n\n6. **Feedback Mechanisms**:  \n   - CO2 initiates warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere, which then amplifies feedback mechanisms like increased water vapor.  \n   - While water vapor contributes to the greenhouse effect, it is not directly emitted by human activities in significant quantities, making it a secondary contributor rather than a primary driver.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Final Decision**:\n\nThe team unanimously concludes that **Option A: Carbon dioxide (CO2)** is the correct answer. This decision is based on the following key factors:  \n\n- CO2 is emitted in the largest quantities due to human activities.  \n- It has the longest atmospheric lifetime among the major greenhouse gases, allowing it to accumulate and exert a persistent warming effect.  \n- It contributes the most to radiative forcing, making it the primary driver of the enhanced greenhouse effect.  \n- Scientific consensus from authoritative organizations like the IPCC supports CO2 as the leading greenhouse gas responsible for human-induced climate change.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer: **A. Carbon dioxide (CO2)**"
