  "question": "A 36-year-old G2-P1 woman in week 33 of gestation presents to the emergency department in acute respiratory distress. She works as a secretary for a local law firm, and she informs you that she recently returned from a trip to the beach. She currently smokes half-a-pack of cigarettes/day, drinks 1 glass of red wine/day, and she endorses a past history of injection drug use but currently denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus with no obvious abnormalities. A D-dimer is found to be elevated, and her V/Q scan reveals a high probability of pulmonary embolism (PE). Her medical history is significant for uterine fibroids, preeclampsia, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, and significant for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Which of the following is the most appropriate choice of management for her post-acute care?",
