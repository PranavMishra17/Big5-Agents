  "question": "A 53-year-old man seeks evaluation from his physician with concerns about his blood pressure. He was recently told at a local health fair that he has high blood pressure. He has not seen a physician since leaving college because he never felt the need for medical attention. Although he feels fine, he is concerned because his father had hypertension and died due to a heart attack at 61 years of age. He does not smoke cigarettes but drinks alcohol occasionally. The blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg today. The physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are ordered and he is asked to monitor his blood pressure at home before the follow-up visit. Two weeks later, the blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. The blood pressure measurements at home ranged from 130/90 to 155/95 mm Hg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal. Lab tests show the following:\nSerum glucose (fasting) 88 mg/dL\n    Serum electrolytes: \nSodium 142 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nChloride 101 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL\nCholesterol, total 250 mEq/L\nHDL-cholesterol 35 mEq/L\nLDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 250 mg/dL\n    Urinalysis:  \nGlucose negative\nKetones negative\nLeucocytes negative\nNitrite negative\nRBC negative\nCasts negative\nRegular exercise and a 'heart healthy diet' are advised. He is started on lisinopril for hypertension. Which of the following medications should be added to this patient?",
