  "question": "A 5-year-old male is brought to the pediatrician by his mother, who relates a primary complaint of a recent history of five independent episodes of vomiting over the last 10 months, most recently 3 weeks ago. Each time, he has awoken early in the morning appearing pale, feverish, lethargic, and complaining of severe nausea. This is followed by 8-12 episodes of non-bilious vomiting over the next 24 hours. Between these episodes he returns to normal activity. He has no significant past medical history and takes no other medications. Review of systems is negative for changes in vision, gait disturbance, or blood in his stool. His family history is significant only for migraine headaches. Vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits. Initial complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and abdominal radiograph were unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
