  "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of rectal bleeding. He describes blood mixed in with the stool, which is associated with a change in his normal bowel habit such that he is going more frequently than normal. He also has some crampy left-sided abdominal pain and weight loss. His symptoms started 2 months ago, but he thought they are due to lack of dietary fiber intake and excess consumption of red meat. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 35 years for which he takes metformin. He also uses daily low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection and occasional naproxen for knee pain. His family history is irrelevant. On examination, his abdomen and digital rectal examination are normal. Colonoscopy shows an ulcerating mucosal lesion with a narrow bowel lumen and biopsy shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the greatest risk factor for colorectal cancer in this patient?",
