  "question": "A 4-week-old male infant is brought to the physician because of a 1-week history of refusing to finish all his bottle feeds and becoming irritable shortly after feeding. He has also spit up sour-smelling milk after most feeds. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 6 weeks ago, for which the mother received one dose of intravenous penicillin. The baby is at the 70th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He appears lethargic. Examination shows sunken fontanelles and a strong rooting reflex. The abdomen is soft with a 1.5-cm (0.6-inch) nontender epigastric mass. Examination of the genitals shows a normally pigmented scrotum, retractile testicles that can be pulled into the scrotum, a normal-appearing penis, and a patent anus. Which of the following interventions would have been most likely to decrease the patient's risk of developing his condition?",
