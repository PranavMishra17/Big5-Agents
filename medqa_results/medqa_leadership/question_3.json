  "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident where he was an unrestrained passenger. On initial presentation in the field, he had diffuse abdominal tenderness and his blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg and pulse is 129/min. Following administration of 2 L of normal saline, his blood pressure is 74/58 mmHg. He undergoes emergency laparotomy and the source of the bleeding is controlled. On the second post-operative day, his blood pressure is 110/71 mmHg and pulse is 90/min. There is a midline abdominal scar with no erythema and mild tenderness. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. He has had 300 mL of urine output over the last 24 hours. Urinalysis shows 12-15 RBC/hpf, 2-5 WBC/hpf, and trace protein. What additional finding would you expect to see on urinalysis?",
