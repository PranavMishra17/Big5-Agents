  "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with worsening joint pain and stiffness. Past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed 3 months ago and managed with celecoxib and methotrexate, and occasional gastric reflux, managed with omeprazole. His vitals are a pulse of 80/min, a respiratory rate of 16/min, and blood pressure of 122/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, the left wrist is swollen, stiff, and warm to touch, and the right wrist is red and warm. There is limited active and passive range of motion at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. A plain radiograph of the hands shows progressive degeneration of multiple joints. Another drug, etanercept, is added to help control progressive arthritis. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be ordered before starting this new medication in this patient?",
