Member 1: Endocrinologist (Lead) - Oversees the long-term management of Graves' disease, including hormonal therapy and monitoring for any related complications post-surgery.
Member 2: Speech-Language Pathologist - Specializes in voice and swallowing disorders, providing rehabilitation services to improve the patient's speech and voice quality following nerve damage.
Member 3: Neurologist - Assesses and advises on nerve damage and potential recovery strategies, contributing neurological expertise to the patient's care.
