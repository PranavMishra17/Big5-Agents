He denies any fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. His past medical history is significant for asymptomatic nephrolithiasis, diagnosed 9 months ago on an upright abdominal radiograph, which has not yet been treated. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, pulse 119/min, and respiratory rate 21/min. On physical examination, the patient is constantly moving and writhing with pain. There is severe right costovertebral angle tenderness. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. A urine dipstick shows 2+ blood. A noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis reveals a 4-mm-diameter radiopaque stone at the right ureteropelvic junction. Several nonobstructing small-diameter stones are noted in the left kidney. Mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney is noted. Intravenous fluids are started and ondansetron is administered. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
