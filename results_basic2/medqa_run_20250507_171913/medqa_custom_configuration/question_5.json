  "question": "A 21-year-old woman is diagnosed with a rare subtype of anti-NMDA encephalitis. During the diagnostic workup, she was found to have an ovarian teratoma. Her physician is curious about the association between anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas. A causal relationship between this subtype of anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas is suspected. The physician aims to identify patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis and subsequently evaluate them for the presence of ovarian teratomas. Which type of study design would be the most appropriate?",
