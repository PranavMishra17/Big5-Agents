  "question": "A 37-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 39/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 58/42 mm Hg. There is no improvement in his blood pressure despite adequate fluid resuscitation. A drug is administered that causes increased IP3 concentrations in arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increased cAMP concentrations in cardiac myocytes. This drug only has a negligible effect on cAMP concentration in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Which of the following sets of cardiovascular changes is most likely following administration of this drug?\n $$$ Cardiac output %%% Mean arterial pressure %%% Systemic vascular resistance $$$",
