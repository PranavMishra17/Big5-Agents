She reports that her pain has become more severe over the last several weeks and is no longer well-controlled by NSAIDs. She notes that the pain is beginning to interfere with her sleep and that she feels she no longer has energy to take care of her 2-year-old son. Upon questioning, the patient also endorses feeling more down than usual recently, little interest in seeing friends, and difficulty concentrating on her work. She admits to feeling that she would be \u201cbetter off dead.\u201d The patient feels strongly that the worsening pain is driving these changes in her mood and that she would feel better if her pain was better controlled.
