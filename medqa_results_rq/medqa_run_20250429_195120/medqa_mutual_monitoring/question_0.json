  "question": "A 54-year-old man with alcoholism comes to the emergency department because of vomiting blood for 6 hours. He has had 3\u20134 episodes in which he has vomited dark red blood during this period. He has had no epigastric pain or tarry stools. On arrival, his temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. He is resuscitated with 0.9% saline and undergoes an emergency upper endoscopy, which shows actively bleeding varices. Band ligation of the varices is done and hemostasis is achieved. He is diagnosed with Child class B cirrhosis. He is concerned about the possibility of recurrence of such an episode. He is asked to abstain from alcohol, to which he readily agrees. In addition to non-selective beta-blocker therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?",
