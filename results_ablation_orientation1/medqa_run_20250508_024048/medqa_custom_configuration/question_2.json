  "question": "An 8-month-old child presents with a history of poor growth and a chronic cough. He was born to a 21-year-old woman at 41 weeks of gestation. Soon after birth, he developed respiratory distress and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit where he was mechanically ventilated for 24 hours. He was initially breastfed, but due to frequent vomiting and loose bowel movements, he was formula fed thereafter. Despite this change, he continued to have loose, large, greasy, foul-smelling stools and failure to thrive. When physically examined, his temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air and the baby\u2019s weight is 6.7 kg (14.8 lb, < 5th percentile). HEENT examination is significant for bilateral otitis media and mild nasal congestion. Normal breath sounds with mild wheezing and rales are heard. What is the pathophysiology behind the patient\u2019s bowel habits?",
